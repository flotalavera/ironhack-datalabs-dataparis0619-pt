In 2011 he signed with Málaga and, two years later, joined Arsenal, winning three FA Cup trophies with the latter club.\\r\\n\\r\\nA full international since 2009, Monreal represented Spain at the 2013 Confederations Cup and the 2018 World Cup.\\r\\n\\r\\nA product of CA Osasuna\\'s youth ranks, Monreal was born in Pamplona, and made his official debut for his hometown club in an away game against Valencia CF on 22 October 2006, in a 0–1 La Liga loss. He finished his first season with ten league appearances, adding two in the campaign\\'s UEFA Champions League; after the Navarrese\\'s relegation to the UEFA Cup, he appeared in four matches as the team reached the last four, being eliminated by fellow league side Sevilla FC.\\r\\n\\r\\nMonreal became first-choice in 2007–08, retaining that status in the subsequent seasons, with another youth product, César Azpilicueta, being the undisputed starter in the other defensive wing.\\r\\n\\r\\nMálaga\\r\\nOn 10 June 2011, Monreal signed a five-year contract with Málaga CF on a €6 million transfer fee. In his first season he initially battled for first-choice status with Eliseu, but ended up only missing seven games as the club finished fourth and qualified for the Champions League for the first time.\\r\\n\\r\\nMonreal scored his only goal for the Andalusians on 27 January 2013, in a 3–2 away win against RCD Mallorca.\\r\\n\\r\\nArsenal\\r\\nMonreal marking Florian Thauvin during a Champions League match against Marseille in November 2013\\r\\nOn 31 January 2013, Monreal joined English side Arsenal on a long-term contract. He was given the number 17 shirt. The fee was undisclosed, but was believed by Sky Sports to be around £8.5 million. He made his Premier League debut against Stoke City two days later in a 1–0 home win.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 23 February 2013, Monreal provided the assist for fellow countryman Santi Cazorla to score the winner in a 2–1 victory over Aston Villa. He scored his first goal for the Gunners on 16 March, opening the scoring in a 2–0 win at Swansea City.\\r\\n\\r\\nMonreal returned from injury on 21 August 2013 to feature in Arsenal\\'s 3–0 win at Fenerbahçe SK in the Champions League group stage play-off, playing the last three minutes in the place of Theo Walcott. On 26 September, he scored the deciding penalty in a shootout against West Bromwich Albion to send his team into the fourth round of the League Cup.\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon the arrival of Alexis Sánchez in the 2014 off-season, Monreal took the vacant number 18 previously worn by Sébastien Squillaci. On 23 August, he assisted Olivier Giroud\\'s late equalizer in a 2–2 draw against Everton. Additionally, an injury crisis in the squad saw him being deployed in an unfamiliar central defender role in a string of games, after Laurent Koscielny was put out of action due to an Achilles tendon injury.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 9 March 2015, Monreal scored the opening goal in a 2–1 win over Manchester United at Old Trafford that put Arsenal through to the semi-finals of the FA Cup. He played the full 90 minutes in the final, a 4–0 defeat of Aston Villa at Wembley Stadium.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 19 January 2016, Monreal signed a new long-term contract with Arsenal. On 23 April 2017, he scored the vital equalizer as his team came from behind to defeat Manchester City in the FA Cup semi-final at Wembley.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 6 November 2017, after good performances on the left side of a three-man defence, Monreal won the Professional Footballers\\' Association Player of the Month award for October of that year. The following 20 January, he netted once and made two assists before retiring injured 30 minutes into an eventual 4–1 home win against Crystal Palace.\\r\\n\\r\\nInternational career\\r\\n\\r\\nMonreal taking on Chile\\'s Eduardo Vargas in a 2013 friendly\\r\\nIn 2007, Monreal earned his first call for the Spain under-21 team. He started all their matches in the 2009 UEFA European Championship, in an eventual group stage exit.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 6 August 2009, Monreal was selected to the senior side for the first time, for an exhibition game with Macedonia. He played the last 15 minutes for Joan Capdevila in a 3–2 away success; on 7 September 2010, in the nation\\'s second game after they won the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa, he played the entire 1–4 friendly loss to Argentina.\\r\\n\\r\\nMonreal was a member of the Spanish squad which reached the final of the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup in Brazil, although he was second-choice left back behind FC Barcelona\\'s Jordi Alba. He started in the last two group games, beginning with a 10–0 win over Tahiti at the Maracanã in which he set up a David Villa goal.\\r\\n\\r\\nMonreal scored his first goal for Spain on 12 November 2016, contributing to a 4–0 defeat of Macedonia for the 2018 World Cup qualifiers in Granada.

Since making his Ipswich Town debut, Maitland-Niles\\' performances immediately made an impact and was praised by manager Mick McCarthy, describing him as \"outstanding\". His performance then saw him being named the club\\'s player of the month for September.

His second goal for the club came on 19 January 2016, in a 2–1 loss against Portsmouth in the third round replay of the FA Cup.

After making thirty-two appearances and scoring two times in all competitions, Maitland-Niles returned to his parent club.\\r\\n\\r\\nReturn to Arsenal\\r\\nOn his return to Arsenal the following season, Maitland-Niles started a match away at the City Ground against Nottingham Forest in the EFL Cup at right-back.

He came on in the 74th minute as Arsenal was victorious by a 2–0 margin against Sutton United in the fifth round of the cup.\\r\\n\\r\\nMaitland-Niles established himself as a regular first team player in Arsene Wenger\\'s final season as manager of the club, making 28 total appearances in all competitions. On 12 June 2018, he signed a long term contract at Arsenal. On 12 August 2018, in Unai Emery\\'s first match as manager, Maitland-Niles started at left-back. However, he would be subbed off 35 minutes into the match after suffering a broken leg.\\r\\n\\r\\nInternational career\\r\\nMaitland-Niles has played for England at various levels within the youth setup of the Three Lions. He made three appearances for England U17 in 2014.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was then called up by England U18 in November 2014 and scored on his debut, in a 3–2 win over Poland U18. He went on to make four appearance for the England U18 side.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn September 2015, Maitland-Niles was called up by England U19 and scored on his England U19 debut, in a 3–2 win over Germany U19 on 4 September 2015. He scored again the following month, in a 2–0 win over Macedonia U19. He was then included in the England U19 squad for the UEFA European Under-19 Championship that saw them reached the semi-final of the tournament.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 1 September 2016, Maitland-Niles scored on his England U20 debut, in a 1–1 draw against Brazil U20. In May 2017 he was called up to England\\'s squad for the 2017 FIFA U-20 World Cup in South Korea. England eventually got to the final of the tournament where they were up against Venezuela. Maitland-Niles, who came on in the 75th minute of play, went on to raise the 2017 FIFA U-20 World Cup as England beat Venezuela by a 1–0 margin. This triumph also served to be the first time that England have ever won the Under 20 World Cup.\\r\\n\\r\\nPersonal life\\r\\nMaitland-Niles said he credited God and his family for his football career. He also said he preferred playing in the centre of midfield, describing it as \"his natural position.\"',\n",

       "   'strDescriptionEN': \"Sokratis Papastathopoulos (Greek: Σωκράτης Παπασταθόπουλος, pronounced ; born 9 June 1988), commonly known by the singular name Sokratis, is a Greek professional footballer who plays as a centre back for Premier League club Arsenal and the Greek national team.\\r\\n\\r\\nClub career\\r\\nAEK Athens\\r\\nPapastathopoulos joined AEK Athens from Apollon Petalidiou after being scouted by Toni Savevski. On 26 October 2005, he made his debut for AEK in a Greek Cup match against PAS Giannina, scoring in the seventh minute of the game to help lead AEK to a 3–0 win.\\r\\n\\r\\nArsenal\\r\\nOn 2 July 2018, Arsenal announced that Papastathopoulos has agreed a long-term contract with the club for a reported fee £17.6 million and will wear the number 5 shirt. On 12 August 2018, he made his official debut with the club as a starter, at Emirates in a 2–0 loss against champions Manchester City. On 4 October 2018, Papastathopoulos scored his first for the club, setting the Gunners on their way to a comfortable 3–0 victory over Qarabag in the 2018–19 UEFA Europa League group stage. After just four minutes of play in Baku, the centre-back was left unmarked inside the opposing penalty area, deflecting the ball home after the initial header fell into his path. Papastathopoulos, was named to the UEFA Europa League Team of the Week.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 15 October 2018, Papastathopoulos was forced off during Greece’s 2–0 defeat to Finland and was believed to have sprained his ankle. Papastathopoulos was at the heart of Unai Emery’s defence since the Spaniard took over the reins in the summer and a fixture in a winning run of nine matches.  On 21 February 2019, he netted his second goal as an Arsenal player, taking advantage of a missed punch from BATE Borisov's goalie Denis Scherbitskiy to head the ball into an empty net following a corner kick from Granit Xhaka. The goal sealed a 3–0 home win for Arsenal, sending them through to the round of 32 in the 2018-19 UEFA Europa League.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 12 April 2019, Papastathopoulos was named to the UEFA Europa League’s ‘Team of the week’, a second time during the season, after playing a vital role in Arsenal’s 2-0 win over Napoli in their quarterfinal first leg matchup. Papastathopoulos was one of four Arsenal players selected in the Europa League ‘Team of the week’ along with Petr Cech, Ainsley Maitland-Niles, and Aaron Ramsey. On 24 April 2019, Papastathopoulos scored his maiden goal in the English Premier League rose highest to connect with a corner from the right wing, masterfully heading the ball into the net from point blank range, but Arsenal slipped to a 1-3 defeat against Wolverhampton Wanderers.\\r\\n\\r\\nInternational career\\r\\nPapastathopoulos playing for Greece in 2013\\r\\nPapastathopoulos was called up for the Greek senior team on 1 February 2008 and made his debut on 5 February 2008 in the 1–0 friendly victory against the Czech Republic. The Greece squad for UEFA Euro 2008 was announced by Otto Rehhagel on 27 May 2008, and Papastathopoulos was the unfortunate player to be cut from the provisional squad of 24 to the final 23-man selection.\\r\\n\\r\\nPapastathopoulos became the first player to be sent off at UEFA Euro 2012 during the opening game of the tournament against co-hosts Poland after receiving two yellow cards, following what pundits decried as two poor decisions by referee Carlos Velasco Carballo.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn June 2014, Papastathopoulos was named to Greece's squad for the 2014 FIFA World Cup. He started in each of the team's group matches, helping them to a clean sheet against Japan. In the round of 16, Papastathopoulos scored his first international goal, equalising in second half stoppage time against Costa Rica. However, the Greeks were eventually defeated 5–3 in a penalty shootout by the Central American champions.\",\n",

       "   'strDescriptionEN': 'Henrikh Mkhitaryan  born 21 January 1989) is an Armenian professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for English club Arsenal, as well as captaining the Armenia national team. Mkhitaryan is Armenia\\'s all-time top goalscorer, scoring 19 goals in 59 international matches since his debut in January 2007, including their first hat-trick. His previous clubs include Pyunik, where he came through the youth system, Metalurh Donetsk, Shakhtar Donetsk and Borussia Dortmund.\\r\\n\\r\\nMkhitaryan has been chosen Armenian Footballer of the Year five times (every year since 2009, except 2010). In 2012 he was voted as the best Shakhtar player of 2011–12 season by the fans, and Ukraine Premier League MVP. In 2012, Mkhitaryan was named in UEFA\\'s Top 100 players by UEFA European Football Yearbook 2012–13. Mkhitaryan was voted the CIS Footballer of the Year for 2012, making him the first Armenian footballer to be named the best player from post-Soviet countries. He received the award again for 2013. Mkhitaryan received the nickname Heno from his fans in Armenia and has been nicknamed Micki by his Borussia Dortmund fans.\\r\\n\\r\\nMkhitaryan was born on 21 January 1989 in the Armenian capital Yerevan to Marina Taschyan and Hamlet Mkhitaryan, a prominent striker of FC Ararat Yerevan during the 1980s, who died of a brain tumor at age 33 when Mkhitaryan was seven years old. His mother is the head of the national teams department in the Armenian Football Federation and his elder sister, Monica, works at UEFA\\'s headquarters.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the beginning of the 1990s, the Mkhitaryan family moved to France, where Hamlet Mkhitaryan played for the now defunct ASOA Valence and helped them to be promoted to the second division Ligue 2. Mkhitaryan spent his early childhood in Valence. He always wanted to become a football player and began to follow in his father\\'s footsteps. As a child, he would watch his father play and always wanted to follow him to training. The Mkhitaryans returned to Yerevan in 1995. In the same year Mkhitaryan joined the youth system of FC Pyunik. He graduated from the Institute of Physical Culture in Armenia. He studied economics at the Yerevan branch of the St. Petersburg Institute. Upon graduation, he plans to study there as a lawyer. In 2003, Mkhitaryan, aged 14 had trials with São Paulo in Brazil where he played alongside the likes of Hernanes and Oscar. He returned back to Pyunik in 2004, then manager Mihai Stoichiță insisted on his return to Armenia. Growing up, Mkhitaryan considered Zinedine Zidane his football idol.\\r\\n\\r\\nMkhitaryan is an attacking midfielder capable of playing second striker as well. He thrives playing just behind the strikers, where he always looks to link up with his teammates in and around the box. Tearing apart opposition defences time and time again, he makes space for the striker/wingers to exploit and create goal scoring opportunities. Mkhitaryan has been praised for his technique, movement, accurate passing, dribbling, creativity, ball control and work rate. He is equipped with a dangerous shot, trickery to beat defenders, and a superb vision to go for the pass.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the 2012–13 season, former Scottish footballer Pat Nevin said of Mkhitaryan, \"Eleven goals in eight league matches already is fantastic, but when you add that he is a midfielder, it is phenomenal. You may not have heard of him yet, even if all the scouts at the top European clubs have, but you soon will. He has pace, skill, a rocket of a shot and the ability to arrive in the box like Frank Lampard. This all singles him out as a player who must be watched or more importantly marked.\"',\n",

       "   'strDescriptionEN': 'Granit Xhaka (Albanian pronunciation: ; born 27 September 1992) is a Swiss professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for English club Arsenal and the Switzerland national team. Swiss national manager Ottmar Hitzfeld once dubbed him the \"young Schweinsteiger\", while former Arsenal defender Johan Djourou has praised his tackling, versatility, and physicality.\\r\\n\\r\\nXhaka began his career at hometown club Basel, winning the Swiss Super League in both of his seasons. He then moved to Bundesliga team Borussia Mönchengladbach in 2012, playing 140 official games and scoring nine goals.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe has been a full international for Switzerland since 2011, gaining more than 40 caps. He was included in their squad for the 2014 FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro 2016.\\r\\n\\r\\nXhaka was born in Basel, Switzerland to Kosovo Albanian parents and is the younger brother of Taulant Xhaka, who is also a professional footballer and plays for the Albania national football team and played against Granit in the second Euro 2016 match. Their family moved from Kosovo to Switzerland shortly before their children were born.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe brothers started their youth football by Concordia Basel and both moved to Basel in 2002. Xhaka played for various Basel youth teams and since 2008 has been a member of the U-21 squad. Between 2008 and 2010 he played 37 games for the U-21 team, scoring eleven goals.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore making his international debut for Switzerland, Xhaka was still undecided whether to play for his birth country or Albania, and he complained to the Albanian sports media that FSHF was ignoring him while the Swiss Football Association was showing much more interest.\\r\\n\\r\\nXhaka debuted for Switzerland at Wembley Stadium against England, in a 2–2 UEFA Euro 2012 qualification draw on 4 June 2011. On 15 November of the same year, during his sixth international appearance, he scored his first international goal in the 1–0 away win against Luxembourg in Stade Josy Barthel.\\r\\n\\r\\nSwitzerland also tried to select him to participate in the 2012 Olympic Football tournament, but he opted to stay at his new club for pre-season training. Xhaka participated in all ten of Switzerland\\'s 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification campaign matches, scoring both goals in a 2–0 defeat of Slovenia.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 2 June 2014, Xhaka was named in Switzerland\\'s 2014 FIFA World Cup squad by national coach Ottmar Hitzfeld. In the team\\'s second match, Xhaka scored in a 5–2 loss to France.\\r\\n\\r\\nXhaka was selected for UEFA Euro 2016, where Switzerland\\'s campaign opened against Albania in Lens. Xhaka, whose team won 1–0, was playing against his own brother while their mother watched from the crowd in a t-shirt blending the two nations\\' flags. He was voted the man of the match. Xhaka played every minute of Switzerland\\'s campaign, which ended in the last 16 with a loss to Poland at the Stade Geoffroy-Guichard; after a 1–1 draw he was the only player to not score in the penalty shootout, shooting wide.',\n",

After eight years of playing for Kalsruhe, Kolašinac joined 1899 Hoffenheim, where he played a season, afterwards being bought by VfB Stuttgart. Kolašinac's stay at Stuttgart was short-lived, and a season later, he joined Schalke 04.\\r\\n\\r\\nKolašinac is regarded as a defensive all-rounder which means that he can be deployed in multiple defensive positions. In Kolašinac's Schalke 04 II career, he was deployed mostly as a centre back or defensive midfielder. Schalke head coach Jens Keller has primarily deployed Kolašinac as a left full-back; a playing position in which Kolašinac has received praise. Kolašinac is deemed to be physically strong and tough in his physique, clever defensively on the pitch and defensively consistent in winning one-on-one duels against his opponents.\\r\\n\\r\\nKolašinac was born in Karlsruhe, Baden-Württemberg, to Bosniak parents. His father, Faik, works at a Mercedes-Benz factory. Faik was born in Nikšić, SR Montenegro, to parents from Plav, SR Montenegro; the family moved to Čapljina, SR Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1969, where Faik met his wife. Kolašinac and his family are practising Muslims.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs well as having a German passport Kolašinac was given a Bosnian passport in 2013 and decided to play for the Bosnian national team.\",\n",

       "   'strDescriptionEN': 'Lucas Sebastián Torreira Di Pascua (born 11 February 1996) is a Uruguayan footballer who plays as a defensive midfielder for Premier League club Arsenal and the Uruguay national team.\\r\\n\\r\\nClub career\\r\\nTorreira started his youth football career at hometown club I.A. 18 de Julio of Fray Bentos. In 2013, he joined Montevideo Wanderers\\' youth team, he then moved to Italy where he joined Pescara\\'s youth team.\\r\\n\\r\\nPescara\\r\\n\\r\\nTorreira playing for Pescara in 2014\\r\\nBefore the 2014–15 season, Torreira was called up for Pescara\\'s first team and, on 25 October 2014, he sat on the bench for the first time. He made his senior debut in Serie B on 16 May 2015 against Varese, playing the game in the starting line-up. In this game, he played 58 minutes before he was replaced with Matteo Politano. He played five games including promotion playoffs in the season.\\r\\n\\r\\nSampdoria\\r\\nOn 1 July 2015, Torreira transferred to Sampdoria for €1.5 million, but he remained with Pescara on loan for the 2015–16 season to gain first-team experience.\\r\\n\\r\\nPescara (loan)\\r\\nOn 2 July 2015, he was loaned to Pescara. On 9 August 2015, Torreira scored his first professional goal against F.C. Südtirol in the 2015–16 Coppa Italia. He played 26 games and scored three league goals. He also played three games and scored one goal in the promotion playoffs.\\r\\n\\r\\nReturn to Sampdoria\\r\\nAfter the Pescara loan expired, the player returned to Sampdoria on 1 July 2016. On 21 August 2016, Torreira made his Serie A debut in their opening game against Empoli at the Stadio Carlo Castellani. He started the game and played the entirety of the 90+ minutes on the field.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe became a regular for Sampdoria in the 2016–17 season, and continued showing his importance to the team in the 2017–18 season; scoring vital goals, including the second goal in Sampdoria\\'s 3–2 win over Juventus in November.\\r\\n\\r\\nArsenal\\r\\nAfter a summer of speculation, Torreira joined English club Arsenal on 10 July 2018 for an undisclosed fee, believed to be around £26.4m. Upon the completion of the signing, head coach Unai Emery said \"In Lucas Torreira, we have signed a young player who is a very bright talent in the game. A midfielder with great quality, I have enjoyed watching his performances for Sampdoria in the past two seasons, and we all saw him do very well for Uruguay in the World Cup. He is a young player already with good experience, but who wants to keep on growing.\" Torreira was given the number 11 shirt, previously worn by Mesut Özil, who took the vacant number 10, following the departure of Jack Wilshere.\\r\\n\\r\\nInternational career\\r\\nTorreira was called up to full Uruguay squad for the 2018 China Cup in March 2018. He made his debut in the 2–0 win over the Czech Republic in the China Cup semi final.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn May 2018 he was named in Uruguay\\'s provisional 26 man squad for the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia.\\r\\n\\r\\nStyle of play\\r\\nUpon signing for Arsenal in 2018, The Independent\\'s Jack Austin stated \"Torreira is exactly the kind of no-nonsense midfielder the club have been craving\", adding that in Uruguay colours during the 2018 World Cup \"he went about his job as the deep-lying pivot in the middle of the park with none of the fuss and all of the discipline of a player who has built a tidy reputation for himself in Serie A\", while assessing his chief weaknesses as a lack of height in aerial duels and little goal threat.',\n",

       "   'strDescriptionEN': \"Unai Emery Etxegoien (Spanish pronunciation: ; born 3 November 1971) is a Spanish football manager and former player. He is the head coach of Premier League club Arsenal.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a modest playing career, spent mostly in Spain's Segunda División, Emery transitioned into coaching after retiring in 2004. He began at Lorca Deportiva CF, where he achieved promotion to the Segunda División in his first season, and was awarded the Miguel Muñoz Trophy. He then joined Almería, who he led to promotion to La Liga for the first time in the club's history. This earned him a move to La Liga heavyweights Valencia, where he regularly led the team to top three finishes. After leaving Valencia, he coached Spartak Moscow for six months, before moving to Sevilla in 2013.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt Sevilla, Emery gained plaudits for his style of football, and shrewdness in the transfer market alongside Monchi, the club's director of football. He achieved an unprecedented three consecutive Europa League victories, which earned him a move to French club Paris Saint-Germain in 2016. Although he achieved limited European success at PSG, he won the Coupe de France, Coupe de la Ligue and Trophée des Champions in his first year. He won all four domestic trophies in his second season, including Ligue 1, the Coupe de France, the Coupe de la Ligue and the Trophée des Champions. After the expiry of his contract, he moved to English side Arsenal in 2018.\",\n",
