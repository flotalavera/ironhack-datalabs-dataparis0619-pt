Angel,"Angel has a very unique scent that I never find it similar with any other perfume. And most of mugler perfume has their own uniqueness. I don’t really like it at first, but the more I smell it, the more I like the scent. With angel, you only need 2 spray for the entire day. Love it!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"Love this perfume. All though it does have a hint of armpit smell.. but for some reason its intriguing? Definitely stays on a really long time but so does the armpit smell. Its weird, its like a hint of armpit. Its good and then boom armpit and you get taken a back a bit but then smell the goodness again and you forgot the armpit smell but then occasionally get reminded of it",4,Sephora,us
Angel,"Good lord, when I first sprayed this I almost flipped over backward into my bathtub. It was certifiably horrific. However, I didn't want to change my outfit (you feel me?), so I was stuck with what I thought was sure to be a day of avoidance. However, a few hours into my trial I started to question, what IS that smell? It was ME! Smelling like a somewhat delightful vixen. I got home, hung up my button-down and went to bed, thankful no one booted me from their presence. I woke up the next morning and went to the shirt just to see the damage, and would you believe that shirt smelled amazing? I mean AMAZING. I was so confused that I went to the trial spritzer again and sprayed it on my new outfit and BAM. Once again hit with a HORRIFIC, soul-curling smell. Perplexed, I wore it awhile longer and it amazingly developed once again into a beautiful smell. Basically, this will knock you off your feet but stay with it because it develops into a completely different perfume. I now know to spray it on my clothes the night before so it can turn from WILDLY offensive to magnificent. Hope this helps!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,Love this fragrance! Very mature smell! Amazing but a little goes a long way. One spritz is all you need LITERALLY!,5,Sephora,us
Angel,This may be the worst smell known to man.  I would rather smear dog poop on my arm and deal with that than this.  This scent(and I am not scent sensitive) gives me an instant headache along with overpowering nausea.  Gross. Gross. Gross.,1,Sephora,us
Angel,"Love, love love it. So glad to order it and receive it so fast.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,This is my facve scent of all time. So much so that i refuse to tell people what it is! OMG the uniqueness commands the room and it lasts for hours subtly changing just enough to make me realize...hey i smell amazing. LOL this is a classic that will always be in my collection!,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I bought this blind during the big August sale.  The descriptions (thank you, Sephora regulars) intrigued me, and the “sophisticated gourmand” description got to me as well.  I’ve had it for several days, here’s the thoughts:

1) doesn’t smell like BO.  Too many people have mentioned this in reviews for it to be a joke or a one-off; there must be SOMETHING to this BO smell.  But if so, my novice and damaged (full sinus surgery) nose can’t pick it up.

2) it must be so audacious and cutting edge to polarize an entire humanity of nostrils the way it does...but am I crazy for not seeing (or smelling) that?  I find nothing “repulsive” to the degree some of you describe.

What I get: apricot, honey, and musk.  Especially the honey, at least mid-wear.  On me it dries down to a subtle honey musk.  (Which works for me, as my favorite is Blooms and Bees by Michel Designs).  I did buy the EDO spray and the body oil; I liked the body oil scent better though it didn’t have the longevity if the EDP.

Summary:  not a love or hate scent; a nice, albeit heavy, honey musk.  Buy the body oil first.",3,Sephora,us
Angel,"Angel is spicey, intoxicating and sexy. It is a heavy scent that lasts a very long time. I smell it when I wake up the next morning and my clothes smell of it until they get washed. My boyfriend says this is his favorite scent I've ever worn, and I've worn a ton. Not for someone who likes it subtle. Definately a fragrance that draws attention. I am giving it 5 stars because it's longevity and complexity deserves it. Alien is also a favorite, though that scent does not last as strongly on my skin as Angel sadly. More so it becomes a subtle sweet smell vs the empowered jasmine upon first spritz. Angel remains warm, spicy and sexy all throughout it's initial spray and drydown.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I know that it's been mentioned before but it's important to note that no perfume can compliment every person that tries to wear it. However, I can confidently claim that this perfume has performed beautifully on me. It was very potent, but not too overpowering. It was long-lasting and did not require too many sprays. Angel has become an essential for me. To give you a better idea of how this may work for you I've also been a very big fan of Prada Candy, V",5,Sephora,us
Angel,This perfume is my all time favorite!  It goes on intense but after a few minutes the sweet and mildy musky scents work so well together- it's a match made in heaven!  I receive compliments every single day with this perfume and the staying power is amazing!!,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"This sent is heavy, sexy, and irresistible. I got this as a Christmas gift and as a younger woman (17) i thought that this wouldn't suit me. I felt that younger girls should wear younger scents, but i have never really liked floral or sweet scents. But when i tried this i felt confident and powerful. I swear people take me more seriously when i wear this! i'm always getting comments about how good i smell! Your personal chemistry matters too, for i find that ,while delicious smelling on me, it smelt bad on some friends. definitely a signature scent for all ages!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I love Mugler scents in general, my favorite being Alien. I feel like Angel is my second favorite Mugler fragrance after Alien. It is a very complex fragrance, and admittedly not for everyone, but I love it! Angel is very powerful, so you don’t need much at all, and it lasts! It is also really lovely to layer Angel and Alien together, which makes an incredible scent.",4,Sephora,us
Angel,"Love this perfume, it been my favorite going on 10 years! I always get stopped w people asking me what I’m wearing bc I smell so good. The fragrance lasts all day too which is fantastic",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"Be warned, the scent of this changes over time.It goes from smelling complex and warm to reminiscent of a dated, cheap perfume.The top notes of honey, chocolate, and caramel are amazing, but they only last for an hour or so. After they wear off, the only note left is patchouli, and it's so strong that it burns my nose.",1,Sephora,us
Angel,"Omg I love this perfume. This is my first time trying it and I'm in love. It definitely gives me fall and winter vibes. leather boots, leather jacket and scarfs. Christmas winter coats and snow. It makes me feel warm and sexy and it sort of brings me back to childhood memories. I can't pinpoint where I know this scent but it's bringing me back. Yup! I'm in love.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"A must have in my collection. It turns into the most intoxicating woody vanilla on my skin. I will never get tired of it. I also prefer the Perfume over the Toilette, the Toilette version’s Pachouli is just too much for my sensitive nose.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,This is a scent you either love or hate!  I've been wearing it for over 20 years and never get tired of it.  It's very sweet and musky and works so well with my body chemistry.  It's quite strong so one spray on my neck and one on my wrist lasts until the next day.  There are very few perfumes that don't bother my sinuses or give me headaches and this is one of them!,5,Sephora,us
Angel,I've been trying to figure out what parfum this is forever my aunt wore this all the time when I was a pre teen and teen back in the early 90's and I absolutely loved it. she used to spray just a pinch on me always saying how expensive it was.Now I'm scrolling perfumes for a bday gift to myself and come across this!!!!! Now it's a toss up between this and Jo Malone fresh pears and freesia! may just get  both,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"OMG this is worst perfume ever. Why anyone will wanting to smell that bad i don't understand. When i got a sample and sprayed at home i almost broke my legs to run and try to rub it out of my skin, and oh dear - it's NOT come off. It's so so powerful and gives me nausea.",1,Sephora,us
Angel,This fragrance got me in so much good trouble in my younger years.... i hope my husband likes it today cause im ordering it,5,Sephora,us
Angel,Mugler's perfumes are so addictive. I tried this out as a sample (I got several just to make sure I'd like it since it's so different) and I'm saving up for the full sized bottle. It starts off smelling like patchouli and then after it has had time to settle it makes me smell like a vanilla cupcake. I really like the Alien and Aura perfumes too. Heavenly!,5,Sephora,us
Angel,This has become my favorite go to perfume!,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"Purchased this product in 2003, I've been in love ever since .... I look for something I love more, haven't found it yet",5,Sephora,us
Angel,I was looking for a new scent and saw such high reviews decided to give it a try ... however not at all what I was looking for ..it smells very strong more like a mans colegne .. had to return it .,1,Sephora,us
Angel,"This has been my go-to perfume for more than 20 years! Definitely one that folks will comment on. But let me be clear - it is distinctive to each person depending on body chemistry. It wears all day and the dry down on me is incredible and sexy. But some others might not get the same result. It must be noted, though, that I can’t stand patchouli and, thankfully, I don’t smell the patchouli in this. Just warm musky chocolate. Angel is still my favorite!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"Honestly, I strongly dislike this scent, it is way too spicy, too strong. the only reason I would even give it a star is because of how beautiful the bottle is.",1,Sephora,us
Angel,"I just love this fragrance.. classic. feminine. sultry. Just love it! I've been eyeing it for years now, tested at department stores and received samples. I cracked during the Sephora 3x points on fragrances and bought the 10ml travel size perfume. I will be purchasing the full size very soon as this is very likely going to become my new signature. Lasts all day long on me. I simply love this fragrance!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"Has the best staying power of any perfume I have ever had along with Poison I wore in the 90s. It’s very strong so a little goes, a very long way. It’s a mysterious, sensual smell so more of a bar or night out perfume. Too strong for summer day or at work. Love that you can refill the bottle.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,I hate the smell of this. It smells like cheap granny parfume. I got it as a gift and I threw it out.,1,Sephora,us
Angel,"I wouldn’t give this perfume any stars if I could! It smells like someone who didn’t wear deodorant and sweat all day combined with onions. I had high hopes for this because I love notes, but they just didn’t come through in this. My dog smells better than this after she’s gotten wet in the hot and humid climate I live in. I would definitely not recommend this product, except to my stepmother.",1,Sephora,us
Angel,"Thierry Mugler created the most amazing, unique fragrance ... for a strong and confident woman !!  Deep, exotic, dirty patchouli with the decadence of chocolate, fruit, vanilla with a touch of sweet caramel.  I have worn Angel for decades (since the 1990's) and I swear they have re-formulated it to appeal to the general masses.  It just is lacking the ""punch"" and intensity of the old version.  Call me crazy, but I am an Angel ""expert"" (being one of the only EDP's I wear) I find the new Angel formulation to still smell like Angel, just lacking that insane patchouli ""punch"" that the original had.  It's still good ... it's just not mind-blowingly unforgettable as it used to be.  Will I still buy Angel ??  Yes.  It still smells unique enough to qualify as ""not mainstream"".  They should not have messed with ""perfection"".  xx",4,Sephora,us
Angel,"Beautiful lovely scent..., remember not liking it a while back a few years ago but came across it again in the ulta magazine and I said to myself ITS SMELLS So FREAKING GOOD.... different a fall/winter or even spring scent.... the notes in this are everything I smell the caramel, vanilla, honey and when it does settle down I do smell a little bit of the chocolate (a little bit of patchouli too) but in all in all this will be one of my go to scents for years to come.  ; )  recently just bought the travel size.... alien and angel muse will be next on the list",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I love this scent, to describe it- it’s like a peppery musk with floral notes. It’s very unique. Be aware that it is very strong, so one spray should have you set. It’s pricier, but/ no matter which size you buy, it will definitely last you a long time.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I have never smelled any perfume like this - it's truly unique. It's rather heavy, but sweet and has a lot of character. I use the whole range - body lotion, shower gel and perfume. Wonderful product in beautiful packaging. And I LOVE that you can bring your empty bottle to Sephora and get a refill!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I've loved this scent for so long, but didn't feel like I was the ""perfume-type."" What a silly reason to hold back! 
It really doesn't take a lot, and while I think it smells a bit too strong at first, it quickly fades to the perfect level of subtlety. 
Angel is so warm, sexy and nuanced, and I'm thrilled to finally emulate that",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"You really have to try each scent on your skin to find out if it matches your chemistry.  This is my scent!  
The only thing I would say about this brand that I don't like  is the last two times I have ordered his parfum on line and it came with a special free gift, I never received the free gift.  I do feel that if they are going to offer, they should follow through.  I even went to the Sephora store and told them but they said there was nothing they could do.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"Love love love this sweet but smoky fragrance. It’s so unique. What I love most about it is the lasting power. For the first time in a long time I get compliments on the scent ALL day, and I too can smell it through the day! Perfect for Fall and Winter.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,I’ve loved this perfume since my mom used to wear it when I was a kid. Received it as a sample and will definitely be buying it when it runs out. I suggest not smelling it straight from the bottle because it can be a bit strong.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I love this fragrance! Have been wearing it since it came out. Use the body moisturizer, their powder. They changed the fragrance slightly,",5,Sephora,us
Angel,Get ready for a migraine to happen.. It’s way too strong and women don’t wear this fragrance properly they over indulge themselves in it it’s disgusting...,1,Sephora,us
Angel,"Perfect mix of sweet and spicy...sexy, edgy, but warm. When I met my boyfriend he went CRAZY over this perfume and said he had never smelled a perfume like it. Every time I wear it, he says something and I get people asking me what perfume I’m wearing. I will never be without this perfume!!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"This is my favorite smell. When I first got this some time ago, I was not a fan. But I decided to go back, and I'm glad I did. It's such a nice warm smell. I put a small drop on my wrists and let it warm up and that's the way to do it.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"This is the most sexy perfume I believe I've every worn. I FEEL sexy when I where this! I love the warm notes to this. I've had a stranger stop me and ask me what I was wearing. I do wish it would wear a tad bit longer but I also buy the mini sprayer to refresh throughout the day. If you love spicy warm scents, stop in at your local Sephora and try it out. They will also give you a tester to take home with you.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,I wanted to love it.... But ended up giving it away. The sent was really strong and my husband said I smelt like a hippie.,1,Sephora,us
Angel,"I wear many scents but this is one of the 5-6 that is always in rotation.  I get so many complements on this scent, I love it and it is super unique.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"Deep, sensual almost dark scent. I wear it daily because it doesn’t fade throughout the day. If you want something light and floral this isn’t for you. Very sexy fragrance.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"This is my moms favorite scent.
Now when I smell it it reminds me of my mom.
Smells great. Has a warmth to it when I smell it.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,This is a staple for me!!!  Love the smell and never fails me during the course of the day.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"Love love love!! My go to scent for summer, winter, fall. Can’t explain the scent because every person has a different chemical reaction, but this scent matches every reaction...very sexy.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,I do not like spicy scents at all.,1,Sephora,us
Angel,Very musky smelling which I hate so if you don't like musky scents don't buy.,1,Sephora,us
Angel,Great classic fragrance.   This is a must have.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"Classic for a reason. There's a reason that Angel has endured and remains a staple in perfumeries. This fragrance is not only delicious, but it is aromatic, exotic, and warm. There's something uniquely intoxicating about the art of the inhale when you catch a whiff of Angel. And it has staying power. Notes of chocolate and the linger of musk seem to embody this scent. Highly recommended!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"After looking for years for the right perfume that will smell good on me. I finally found it. This perfume is a classic, it smells divine. Adore it.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I get bored of my perfumes so easily, but this one is always at the top of my list and I don’t think I will ever get bored of it.  I love the femininity of it, yet it’s not sweet or flowery, just a very unique sexy scent.  I can wear it anywhere, day or night.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,Wonderful in the winter. A bit dramatic for summer heat. The scent lingers sensually through the day. Love it!,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I wanted to like it, but I couldn’t put my finger on what it smelled like right away, after one week and only 3 sprays, it finally hit me. I smell like my freinds bedroom... the friend who had a pet ferret.",1,Sephora,us
Angel,"This sweet and spicy fragrance is so luxurious and sexy. Angel is for a woman with a strong opinion about the fragrance she wears. Although it's a classic, it isn't a fragrance for everyone. That's one of the lovely things about it.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"In the 25 years since this came out, there have been hundreds (if not thousands) of fragrances built on the ""fruitchouli gourmand"" pyramid Angel created, but Angel is still in a category by itself. I deeply respect it, but don't always love it on my skin. If you think this is going to be a ""sweet candy"" scent like Pink Sugar, Fantasy, or Coco Mad, think again. It's got TONS of patchouli. Deep, camphorous, skanky patchouli. On some people, the patchouli takes backstage to the chocolate and caramel notes. On others, this fragrance is a patch bomb and isn't very sweet at all; almost smells like fruity sweaty armpits. Angel goes patch bomb on me, every time. Good thing I like patch!",4,Sephora,us
Angel,"I have been on the search for this perfume since I was 12 years old. I had got it as a gift and a friend dropped it in the girls bathroom. I couldn't recall the name of it. I'm 28 now. I got a sample of this and at first it didn't smell like anything I remembered. In my mind I was just testing out a perfume I had never tried. 20 minutes later after it had set with my ph I smelled myself and almost cried. Its the one I had so long ago! This perfume is...absolutely phenomenal, heavenly. Its warm, enticing, inviting. Its sultry but innocent. I'm extremely picky when it comes to perfume. This perfume sets the standard.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"This perfume screams old lady- I bought it because the description and reviews were so nice. It sounded like a sweet beautiful perfume but the moment I sprayed it I was horrified. So thick and musky, definitely the worst perfume I've ever smelt. Its so bad that people won't even take mine away from me for free. :(",1,Sephora,us
Angel,"I have been wearing Angel for over 20 years and it my go to signature fragrance. Even though I love fragrances from Jo Malone, Clean, Chanel and Christian Dior, I will always come back to this.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,I love this perfume! I get so many compliments when I wear it! I first tried it when it went to Sephora and got the perfume set where you can try a few at a time. Its perfect because at the end you can get which ever one you want. I so went with this one! Would recommend to a friend!,5,Sephora,us
Angel,I LOVE THIS SCENT!!!!!! I'm a huuuge fan of like really bold scents and this is one of them I always get complimented when I wear this.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"This perfume netted me a wife. 

OK, so I found Angel because I was working at Penguin Books and we published a book of perfume reviews from word renowned perfumers. Angel was listed as one of the best perfumes for women of all time. It was one of the first women's perfumes to mix vanilla with ambergris, it has a woody androgynous backbone. 

It was 2012 and my close friend/person I was secretly in love with and I were having lunch with a mutual friend of ours at Peanut Butter and Co in the west village. She was sitting next to me and we were both pretending that our legs were not touching under the table. She leaned in and asked me, ""What perfume are you wearing? This is the only time I'll ask."" 

We'd acknowledged our mutual attraction before, we were both dating other people. I told her I was wearing Angel by Thierry Mugler. 

""It's nice,"" she said. 

Fast forward and we've been married for five years now. This perfume is spicy and sexy and I love it. You either love it or you hate it.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,The best perfume ever!!!,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I read in Star magazine that all the celebrities are in love with this scent so I tried it at Sephora this weekend.  Big mistake!  I sprayed this on myself once and instantly regretted it.  It is a very heavy scent that, to me, smells like a mixture of cotton candy and alcohol.  I think the only redeeming things about this scent are the bottle and that, if you happen to like this scent, it lasts a long time.",1,Sephora,us
Angel,"I bought the tiny purse spray of this fragrance for a friend. I love the scent, and so does she, but the small spray nozzle easily get clogged and squirts rather than mists the fragrance, so you do need to make sure you give it a wipe down before you use it so you don't get a jet of fragrance to the face. Otherwise a good scent and a great gift for people who want the scent but know they won't use/afford the larger ones.",4,Sephora,us
Angel,Give this a chance on your skin. It smells so intoxicating and sexy. It is a super love no lasting perfume on the skin and I love how it smells tamed down a bit. I wore it out a week ago and my watch and bracelet I had on still smells amazing. I have a super picky and sensitive nose and this doesn't bother me. One of my favorites.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"This is offensive. I always know when someone is wearing Angel and I always wish they weren't. Although apparently popular, I would HIGHLY recommend wearing this when you aren't in a confined area with others. I truly find this repulsive and so the scent cloud is waaaaay too intense. Barf. No.",1,Sephora,us
Angel,"This perfume is the best because it's for everyone. I feel like no matter how your skin chemistry is, it will always mix well. It's that type of perfume that will mix well with any skin chemistry type. Yes the smell can be strong at first but just give it some time to sink in your skin. Trust me!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I approve of the new packaging.  This is a scent that smells far better on the skin than out of the bottle onto a piece of paper.  It develops it's own unique, glamorous, sweet smell on the skin, a gourmand fragrance.  Many people hate it on a cardboard slip though, myself included :)  I've only used the travel size for many years because I felt opposed to how cheap the packaging looked.  I'm happy to see that Mugler has finally updated it and I've added a full-size to my loves list and plan on buying.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I don't find this extremely feminine or ""delicious"" smelling, but it's just really addictive, interesting and different. It's still one of my favorites, just because it's so addictive and weird in a lovely way. Very strong and long lasting. It's provocative in a good way. Love.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"Angel isn't a 'spray on your clothes and go' fragrance (Unless you want the sharp top note of patchouli to linger) Personally I find the patchouli too sour & spicy for my nose  so I prefer to spray on bare skin. That's where she comes alive! After 20 minutes of dry down, Angel becomes a warm, vanilla, chocolate, woodsy musk that I'm so in love with.  Angel remains to be my all time favourite scent after 20  years of habitual fragrance collecting. Give her a shot on bare skin. You won't be disappointed.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I have a number of scents in my collection that I adore but none more than my Angel. One of my favorite ways to wear perfume is applying it before bed. It lingers on my skin, warms up in my sheets, and makes my entire evening and sleeping experience more relaxing and enjoyable. Angel is one of my favorites for daytime and even more so for night time. It is sensual, warm, inviting, and my idea of relaxing aromatherapy. Some of my other favorites for nighttime are Elizabeth & James Bourbon,  Hanae Mori Butterfly, and Tom Ford Black Orchid. If you've never tried it, I highly recommend trying perfumes for a soothing bedtime experience.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I adore my Angel! I own the perfume, lotion",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"All time favorite perfume, I'm a fragrance junkie, I LOVE perfume, but this is my everyday go to, perfect, ideal,  scent!! I've been around this perfume my whole life, and every time I smell it, it just reminds me of my childhood! Beautiful staple for the rest of my life.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"This is the only perfume I have ever worn, about 11 years and counting at this point. I have gotten compliments from so many people on it, and it's so distinct that the occasional stranger will outright ask me if I am wearing Angel. Best of all, the scent becomes your own after wearing all day and sinking into your skin. Love, love, love. Will never wear anything else!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,LOVE love love this beautiful fragrance. I use it every holiday season and always get compliments on it. Idk how anyone could think it smells bad!,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"Ehh, it could be a lot better. Once the scent sets it smells decent.",1,Sephora,us
Angel,"My Boyfriend gifted this perfume ( Came in a 3 piece set ) to me for Christmas. I had never wore anything scent wise like it before, but I am in love. It's an enchanting fragrance that delicately lingers throughout the day. I had 3 people ask me in my office what I was wearing as I usually stick to my Armani Code.. ( It's a stronger scent ). The set is cute too. ( Comes with a lotion and a shower gel .",4,Sephora,us
Angel,My signature fragrance! The most unique notes that invoke an all day or all night feeling of an allure of mystery and fun! Love it!,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I am a huge fan of Thierry Mugler and I was excited to see a fragrance released in a dual advertising package. I was looking for something different for my fall/winter scent and I thought Angel would be it. Thank GOD I tested it in person, it smells AWFUL. It has a strong masculine scent, like someone who hasn't showered in a few days and just threw cologne on top of it. It's so sour and foul and I really wanted to like it. I even tried to smell it later on when the scent had 'settled' and it stank to high heaven. What a terrible fragrance. I love 'Alien' though.",1,Sephora,us
Angel,"Quite honestly when I first smelled this when it initally was launched, I couldn't stand it and felt bad because it bears my name. I tried it again a few years ago and let it settle and mingle with my skin and it was so wonderful. I am not found of sweet smelling scents and this one has enough of a masculine scent that works with my body chemistry. I admit, it is not for everyone, but try it and smell it on your skin 10 minutes later and you might just be surprised. I am often asked what scent I am wearing and when I tell them 'Angel' they think I am joking, since that is my name LOL!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,I've used this perfume for years. The scent lasts and actually changes throughout the day.  It's just glorious and so unique.  Nothing has ever came close to this one.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I have been using Angel for years, I have people walk up to me and ask what I'm wearing and where they can buy it. People that know me always say they know I'm in the room because of Angel . It's been my number one for years and many years to come.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"There is so much hype about this perfume. I picked up a sample and gave it a spray in the air, and let me tell you it was not pleasant what so ever. I don't understand why so many people find this scent pleasing. It smells like someone who hasn't showered in weeks on end and then sprayed a musky perfume over themselves to cover up their smell. The reason I give two stars is because it is very long lasting. I sprayed it in my room and it stayed for several days no matter how many times I febreezed my room.",2,Sephora,us
Angel,"The haters of this perfume are correct: It doesn't smell great at first application or when sprayed on an inanimate object. 

The beauty of this fragrance lies in its opening on your warm skin. 

This is the fragrance I receive the most compliments on.

This is the fragrance that lasts all day.

Try it on your skin before you decide. Or leave more for us enthusiasts.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,My friend showed me this perfume and I love it. The smell lasts pretty long too. The bottle is cute and the smell is unique.,4,Sephora,us
Angel,"This is a super-sexy night perfume, plays well off the heat of your body to create that sultry experience.",4,Sephora,us
Angel,"I sprayed this in the store & couldn't stop thinking about the smell! I tried to get a Friend to buy for me for my birthday but she refused saying this smelled awful and she couldn't be responsible! lol
I just had to have the perfume but was worried about the scent being as pungent as it is, so I bought the rollerball sized sample. I'm enjoying it so far! I enjoy other woodsy perfumes like Lauren, and I have a David Yurman that this is similar to. Angel is still different than both of those and I can't stop smelling my clothes and wrists when I wear!",4,Sephora,us
Angel,Long lasting sweet thing! Been a fan in between other perfumes for over a decade,5,Sephora,us
Angel,Lasts all day and get so many compliments. I can still smell it on my clothes the next day!!! Worth the money.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"This perfume is so different than all others... It smells amazing.. It may be strong at first. However, once it dries, it smells like heaven. People always asks what I am wearing .... This fragrance is very sexy and makes you feel sexy!!!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,Smells like the best sex you ever had!,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I work in the sport of professional boxing, so I wanted a fragrance men would like. 
Found this in Esquire as one of top 5 fragrances men loved on girls/women in 1998. They were right & I wear it to this day. Every time I wear this on its own or with Angel lotion/oil, people stop me & I mean every time! Men at huge boxing events will politely ask about it & would I write it down, so ,they could buy it for their special lady. 
It's very unique, so I'm not surprised by negative reviews, When a perfume has no floral notes people are simply shocked & the aroma is so foreign to them that it's an assault on their senses. Look - most people love it worldwide, Angel was the first of its kind, it was groundbreaking, a complete contradiction, good girl/bad girl, chic, soft yet bold and the caramel, vanilla, patchouli etc...is mouth watering (guys find it sensual)they like what Angel started ""gourmand parfum""
 Even those who personally can't wear it often enjoy it on others. Try it before u buy it and see how it smells after 20 minutes or longer. I would do 2 full sprays and let it develop, then decide. I'm sharing my experience because I see funny reviews about it choking people smells like cat p. etc.. 
This fragrance is intended to be for ladies who can handle it, wear it, own it, eventually it becomes your signature.
Enjoy it! I am bored with floral only or sugar water wanna b's that followed Thierry Mugler.
It's in my top 3 of all time & consider it #1 - still, I do enjoy many different fragrances but this is one is one of a kind.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I tested this fragrance in store and was instantly drawn in by the gorgeous blue glass bottle. At first sniff, I was not a fan... the patchouli note hit me head on, it initially felt too strong and I left the store. Hours later, it had dried down and left behind a sweet, musky, perfectly balanced fragrance.. I purchased the eau de parfum and the hair mist the following week. Don't be afraid of the topnotes! Let it unfold on your skin, and you might fall in love like I did!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"Like the title of my review says...don't judge this one too quick. I agree, the top notes are not for me. They are funky. However, when this dries down, it is AMAZINGLY sultry, seductive, sweet, sexy, and just yummy! I don't recommend making assumptions based off of smelling this after its been sprayed on one of those tester papers in the store.  You won't like it if you do that. You need to spray this on your wrist or arm, leave it for 30-60 minutes and then smell it. :) You will be AMAZED at how different this becomes. I highly recommend it for anyone looking for a sweet, warm, sultry scent for fall or winter. I can imagine myself wearing this one this fall with a cozy sweatshirt and jeans. Just love this!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I only sprayed it on the paper. It smelled very masculine, muddled, and heavy. Not at all ""Pure. Soft. Innocent."" I could not smell the honey, vanilla, or berries.",1,Sephora,us
Angel,"Angel is one of my top five favorite perfumes. I remember smelling it years ago on a woman and asking her what it was and I knew I had to have it. It's somewhat musky, but kind of smells powdery at the same time. There is seriously no other perfume that smells like angel. It lasts all day long I never have to reapply it. if you like fruity perfumes maybe you won't like this one, I'm not a fruity perfume person at all. I will buy this perfume forever!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"Smells like masculine old lady perfume, the kind that you see an old lady walk by wearing and the smell makes you cough and choke. Sprayed this sample on without testing first, choked on if, and smelled bad the rest of the day, doesn't smell girly or flowery or fruity at all. Will never buy this.",1,Sephora,us
Angel,"This scent is not for me. It has a strong patchouli-type note mixed with a slightly sweet deep amber note...it smells like Halloween in a bottle. It dries down to a slightly sweet patchouli & mulch scent. I found it too strong and not feminine at all. Sorry, but there is nothing ethereal or beautiful about this Angel.",1,Sephora,us
Angel,"Got this as a tester.  Didn't like it but it did mellow out ok.  Having said that, my husband and I both feel like this smells like a men's cologne.  Not really a scent is associate with an Angel.  I feel like this is one of those where you either love it or hate it.  Not going to work for me but I appreciated the sample.",1,Sephora,us
Angel,I love this stuff! I wear it every day. Smells fresh and so amazing!,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I wouldn't recommend this perfume to someone I hate. It is so strong it gives you a head ache, and that is with a small spray on your wrist, let alone your neck. Run far away from this product.",1,Sephora,us
Angel,"Received a free sample of this, did not like the sent at all!!",1,Sephora,us
Angel,"Angel will always be in the top 5 of my fragrance collection. I'm confused by the reviews describing it as ""mature"". The notes are sophisticated and complex. This is a truly divine scent that sets itself apart from commercial trends, ""celebrity"" scents and bubblegum fragrances. 
It's a classic in the way that *Chanel Egoiste is, IMO.

*not to be confused with Chanel Egoiste Platinum - they are nothing alike.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"Got a sample of this with my last purchase and I'm so glad I did! This scent is so mature and delicious. I just love it, it feels like I'm being hugged in soft wings of soft and balanced fragrance. Absolutely amazing. Definitely going to look into buying a full size<3 

recommend giving this a chance for those who like more mature unisex perfumes.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"This scent is so bad, I can only describe it as instant headache. I worked at a fragrance store for 5 years and I can handle strong scents. There's just something about this one that I hate. They usually have tester samples in magazines too that I avoid at all costs. Please try this in store before purchasing!",1,Sephora,us
Angel,I love love love this scent and everytime I wear it I get compliments! Very light scent perfect for the day,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"6-13-16
21 years strong! 
I have kept this perfume in my collection for at least 21 years,
This does not fit most women's scent. Which is one of the best reasons I love it!
Eua de parfume makes a bit difference to the Eau de Toilette!!.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I absolutely love this.  It is intoxicating, fresh, clean, and mature.  I love wearing this to work and and night out with my husband.  I receive so many compliments on this when I wear it.  It smells divine.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"This smells like sweaty armpit. Yuck, but try the limited edition one, its better and sweeter and lighter.",1,Sephora,us
Angel,"This is my favorite perfume but my boyfriend can't stand it.  Also, some days it gives me headaches if I'm already a bit sensitive.  Great fragrance but not everyone can handle the smell.",4,Sephora,us
Angel,"Honestly, just try it out one day and see how you like it. I HATED this perfume for a little while, thought it was the worst thing I'd ever smelled but one day [after owning other Mugler perfumes] I figured I'd wear it for a whole day and see how I liked it and I fell in love! The drydown smells amazing and I get compliments on it as well :). 

Originally I thought Alien was my favorite but this is slowly becoming my fave. It also lasts forever! Can't say that about too many perfumes.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I have kept this perfume in my collection for at least 20 years,I have the refillable bottle. The thing I like is that it smells different on everyone. It's a must have if you like powerful scents that are anything but floral.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"My husband bought the entire collection for me one Christmas. You can smell it coming and going however it is very appealing. I get complimented every time I wear it. T is strong but soft and sexy. I bring it on every vacation as the scent does not disappear in heat, humidity or while you sweat while dancing. I will continue to gladly accept this from my very generous husband!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"When I originally sampled this in store on a strip, I thought it smelled horrible and overly musky. My husband came home with a sample for me I sprayed it on with the same result but after about 15 minutes all that bad smell went away and I was taken in by a lovely vanilla with spice (sort of gingery?) and an almost nonexistent patachouli. I'm going to get a big bottle here in a few months after I've already bought my black opium gift set. If you like black opium you will also like angel. I usually pair my black opium with la vanilla pure vanilla... Angel would smell lovely paired with it as well if you want a bit of extra vanilla notes.",4,Sephora,us
Angel,"I wore Angel in my early 20s and thought it was amazing and different. I'm not sure what happened I went and purchased this at another store recently  and was so.happy until I got home and used it and I guess my senses have changed in the last 15 years because I cannot bare this scent on me or anyone else so I returmed.. I was in the grocery store and I knew immediately what the young lady ahead of me in line was wearing. ANGEL it's strong, heavy , sweet and masculine at the same time..",1,Sephora,us
Angel,Love the smell of this. But definitely consider getting the bottle that isn't star shaped because mine ended up drying up faster than I would have liked.,4,Sephora,us
Angel,"I swear this perfume is so weird on me! For some reason Angel smells so disgusting (straight up BO) on me during cold weather but when Spring/Summer comes its amazing! It's dense, powdery and sweet. In the opening I get melon, cotton candy and patchouli and it drys down about 30 minutes later into a cocoa powder, caramel, honey, and patchouli cloud it's really heavenly.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"okay so i got a sample of this perfume and i am SUPER picky about perfumes like i have smelled every perfume in the universe and i literally like about 10 of them, maximum

so my dog was making some funky smells in my room today and i had the sample of Angel right in front of me so I used it to spray around my room. some of it got on my fingers so i wiped it on my wrist. then, i smelled it, and i was like ""oh my god......"" suddenly i felt super emotional and nostalgic and couldn't figure out why! i continued smelling it for the next half an hour and told my boyfriend ""this perfume is making me feel weird... in a good way... its making me feel emotions and its bringing back memories but I'm not sure what those memories are or what I'm feeling...."" and i couldn't bring myself to stop smelling my wrist!

then, i went online to see how much the perfume cost because obviously i need to buy it, and this is the description:

""Angel, the first perfume by Thierry Mugler, evokes the emotion of tender childhood memories together with a sense of dreamlike infinity.

Angel, which launched a new fragrance category called the ""oriental gourmands,"" seduces us with angelic flavors found deep within the heart of our memories, as well as sensual and passionate notes.""

WHAT IS THIS SORCERY!??! HOW DO THEY DO THIS??? THIS ISN'T PERFUME, IT'S A MAGICAL POTION!!!! I'm really wigging out because i have never had a perfume affect me in this way (at least, not without me knowing that the scent is directly associated with a particular memory or place or person....)

basically i am buying this forever because this is some voodoo for real",5,Sephora,us
Angel,I love this scent. You only need a little but it is a beautiful fragrance.,3,Sephora,us
Angel,"Like any perfume (especially with parfums) your skin and general ph levels determine how something will smell on you. If you are used to cheeky, fresh floral/citrus scents, you won't enjoy most of Theirry Muglers scents. If you are not into gourmands, look away.
I'm young but I've always worn warmer, richer scents. Pachouli is luscious on my skin. Angel smells warm, deep, and comforting on me. My husband breathes me in deep, and says I smell like love.
Most turn their noses up at first Spritz, which truthfully can smell quite musky. But the dry down is where it's at, y'all!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I am a fragrance addict, but I keep going back to this one. If it loves your skin it is magical. It make you instantly confident. I love it, I will keep wearing it because it makes me happy!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"Where to start? Almost everybody knows Angel, an extremely unique scent, that is very recognizable, yet not. Is that chocolate, burnt sugar, incense, a sweaty but clean man? I have got no idea, but it is a warm enveloping scent. I love that the bottle is refillable, but it will take a long time to finish a bottle as it is a one spritz scent. The only caveat, is to use a light hand, It is very strong, one light little spritz goes a very long way.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"This is technically a gourmand scent, but I feel it has such deep, rich layers of musk that it can't be pinned down to one category.
This is a true ""love it or hate it"" perfume, as I've yet to find someone who has no strong feelings one way or another. Be sure to test it out before buying to see how it melds to your personal scent
I personally adore Angel. It'is potent so use a light hand when applying. For me. two sprays are more than enough for an entire day. It's is long lasting and is perfect for nights out.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"Honey, chocolate, warm, inviting. When I wear this I can't stop smelling myself.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"If you love Patchouli - you will love this fragrance.. And, it just so happens that I do.. 
This is what Tom Ford's White Patchouli should smell like - 
It's a beautiful scent that has hints of rose & grapefruit  when first sprayed. It settles into a sweeter smelling Patchouli on me.. 
So glad I purchased this one.... 
This is pretty much the fragrance I was looking for...",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"This was my late mother's signature scent and I remember it from her embrace. For years I could not wear fragrance because of allergies, but this scent is kind to me and I love it.
I wear it in her honor and also for me. It is the kind of fragrance that makes you take a deep breath and sigh in contentment.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"Got two samples (ordered two different times) and sprayed it on. I think my nose hairs burned off! I hated it.. and unfortunately it lasted ALL DAY. Didn't bother giving the second sample to a friend, I don't wish this scent on anybody! No way to describe the scent except horrible",1,Sephora,us
Angel,I received a free sample of this with my online order. I was excited to smell this perfume since the reviews for it are pretty positive but I was totally underwhelmed when it arrived. One spray and I knew this scent is definitely not for me. It's very strong and quite masculine.,1,Sephora,us
Angel,"I love the smell on it's own, but it doesn't work with my body chemistry. I'm sensitive to floral notes so I tried a sample. Still have a headache two days later - it is STRONG! Definitely try before you buy. Bummed 'cause I love the pretty bottle!",3,Sephora,us
Angel,"I get so many compliments when I wear this, I feel more confident. It smells really good, I got this as a gift for Christmas and the bottle is really nice. I love how this Perfume doesn't smell too girly, flowery, fruity. It smells sooooo good.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,I absolutely adore this perfume! It has been my signature perfume for the past 10 + years. It's true ..a little goes a long way & I am constantly getting compliments on it.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I love this scent... It is one that I purchase time and again. Great for fall and winter. It is warm, exotic, sexy. A little goes a long way - long lasting, high quality.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"ordered a nice looking refillable bottle - got the tube of ""refill"" perfume - no where did the picture of the tube appear in the website",3,Sephora,us
Angel,"This perfume is phenomenal! Although very strong when first applied, it mellows down to a soft, honey-patchouli scent on me. I get countless compliments every time I wear it, and it lasts a substantial amount of time on me. It is a very high quality fragrance and is well worth the money.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"Reading through the comments, I decided to go in the store to try it out myself before purchasing and im glad i did. While for some people it doesnt work out, this absolutely smells amazing and i like how it settled with my chemistry! Try it before you purchase---- it really is different for everyone.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,This particular brand and scent has always been a favorite. Soft and provocative smelling.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"It's a scent I used to wear back in my early twenties, I used to constantly get compliments when I wore it then so decided to spritz it on today at the store. At first I wondered how I ever wore it, but it continued to grow on me as the day went on. It's very diverse--sweet yet musky, stays on really well and seems like a cozy scent for the winter. Love!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,Got this for my mom as a gift(she wanted it) but i smelled it and it does not smell good at all! Closer to B.O then perfume!,1,Sephora,us
Angel,"Honnêtement, je ne suis pas fan de l'arôme dès l'application. Pourtant, après quelques instants la chaleur du corps se mêle aux effluves et c'est divin ! Idéalement, je le vaporise le matin et en avant midi c'est délicieux ! Très sexy comme parfum. Je l'adore et j'en mettrais partout sur mes vêtements aussi. Je ne suis pas super tolérante aux parfums mais celui-ci est magique et me vaut plusieurs compliments et rapprochements ;)",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I come back to this scent a lot during the winter months. It's always one that people stop me and ask what I'm wearing! My boyfriend loves the complexity of the scent because it isn't the typical women's floral scent (which I don't like anyway). I also like the spray mini travel size, because once the seasons change this is an overpowering scent to me so I would never use up a full bottle. I recommend it if you are in for something intriguing and new in the perfume department!",4,Sephora,us
Angel,My all time favorite! It smells amazing. Lasts all day too. You can't go by this without trying it on your own skin. Smelled better once I actually put it on.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I wish I had not paid attention to all the negative reviews of Angel. I bought the very small spray to try it out, because I'm a big vanilla fan. Big Mistake. Huge. Well, I really like this fragrance. Apprehensive at first, but the afterwards is lovely. Maybe this perfume is for the non-conformists out there. Giving it 4 stars because I would not wear it everyday.",4,Sephora,us
Angel,I recieved this as a free sample and it is the WORST scent I've ever smelt. It's very masculine but not even in a good way. This is a nose wrinkle inducing smell so I'd definitely recommend smelling it in store before you buy...,1,Sephora,us
Angel,"Smells like candy....from the 80's....starburst? I happen to like it, but it is a little old lady. Not for everyone, much different than the everything smells alike mode of most of today's scents...",4,Sephora,us
Angel,Love Love Love this fragrance!,5,Sephora,us
Angel,Reminds me of that old woman's perfume smell,1,Sephora,us
Angel,my mom got this from a friend as a gift. at first we thought it would smell real good judging from its package and container presentation but boy one spray and whiff had us knocked out. it was over bearing. it didn't smell pleasing to any of us.,1,Sephora,us
Angel,I wear this perfume every single day and every single day I get compliments. People tell me I smell amazing. I am not even exaggerating. It is the best smelling most amazing scent and perfume ever. I love it. Can't live without it. And it lasts ALL day. From the time I walk into work until the end of a long day I still get compliments. Seriously.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"My husband surprised me with a bottle of Angel. He liked the scent and asked one of his clients what she was wearing. My first impression was that it was much stronger and more complex than what I have been wearing, but after wearing it for a few days I have decided that it is a full bodied scent that changes and becomes unique to your body chemistry. After about 30 minutes it softens, the vanilla and patchouli comes through on me and it smells very feminine.",4,Sephora,us
Angel,"When I got this in the mail earlier today I was stoked. Upon opening the package I was delighted with the packaging because, honestly, the packaging is so cute. Upon my first whiff of the perfume I was startled by the smell of the perfume because it was very strong and slightly offensive. Even after I washed my wrists (multiple times) I still couldn't get the smell off my skin. Even after a few hours I can still smell it and it still smells terrible.",1,Sephora,us
Angel,"WORST smell EVER, can't stand it, i only brought it because the container looks pretty, but now i regretted it to my bone...",1,Sephora,us
Angel,"Please, please test this perfume before you buy it! It's definitely one of those that works amazingly on some but not on others.

I'd been looking for a new perfume for a while before I found this one. I spritzed a little on my wrists and my first impression, right after spraying, was that it smelled very strong and wasn't particularly great. Then, after leaving the store, I decided to see how it settled and smelled it again. It had completely transformed into something incredibly unique and subtly beautiful. I was totally blown away. It lasted for the rest of the day (from one little spritz!) before eventually fading into a lingering, light-yet-heady sweetness. My favorite thing about Angel is that it smells like me -- it somehow lets my own skin's natural scent come through a bit, but the other scents make it smell so amazing. It doesn't smell fake or unnatural; it meshes well with my chemistry.

The thing about this perfume is that one, you have to test it and make sure it works for your body chemistry, and two, the only way to really experience it is to let it settle. I've found that (on me) it starts to settle into a really nice scent about fifteen to twenty minutes after application. Some people have claimed it smells ""masculine"" -- I'm pretty sure that's just the initial sharpness of Angel right after spraying it. When you give it a little time, it blooms into something more feminine and flattering. Definitely a great scent for fall and winter. If you're interested in it, just go to Sephora and try it on for a day. See how you feel about it after 24 hours, and then decide whether you want it or not.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I cannot keep a scent on to save my life, must be the oils in my skin, I can get away with an hour at most. BUT I tried Angel when it was a bonus sample and it's the only scent that stays on me all day long. I love it, it smells like baby powder, vanilla, and patchouli in perfect harmony. Angel doesn't fade, give it a try, the scent will take you back, I cant explain it but it makes me feel beautiful, angelic and cozy.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,Smell terrible and made me nauseous. Had to change my clothes and wipes by body with a wet towel to remove the smell after I tried it. Cannot stand the smell at all. I think its a love hate perfume. Please try it on a tester card before applying on your body to know for sure if you can stand it because if not it may spoil your day.,1,Sephora,us
Angel,"I absolutely love this scent. I have for a good 10 years. I finally bought the full size bottle last weekend. But strangely, it only lasts maybe up to 2 hours on me. I sometimes get very faint patchouli-esque whiff of it later into the day, but that's it. I don't understand?? Everyone and their mother says it lasts and lasts and is a powerhouse of sillage. Did I get a watered down bottle?? Usually the dry down (from samples I've used) lasts the rest of the day (well into the next day, or even through a shower!). I feel like mine is super strong for about 20min and then fades away instead of the usual lingering sweet sexiness. :/",4,Sephora,us
Angel,"Got this as a sample and I absolutely love it !!
It smells so delicious mature and pretty , a little sweet but not overly , a little like chocolate , it's hard to describe , I suggest any one interested trying it for sure ! I will repurchase this for myself , I just ordered the cream too because my skin gets so dry in the winter and I would love the scent to last , which this does i sprayed it on over 5 hours ago and I can still smell it on myself .
It's a bit pricier of a perfume but it's so very worth it , worth every penny !!! Since one spray will last you a long time !! And the bottle is absolutely gorgeous and unique !!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"This scent is not for everyone... in fact, when I first put it on I was determined I didn't like it. I am not a fan of vanilla and I detected that right away. Then as it settled, I started to smell the depth and warmth of this scent. After a few hours, I was captivated and delighted by how completely different it was from anything else in my collection. I could barely smell any vanilla and found that it was far more sophisticated and sultry. My hubby couldn't stop smelling me and said it was one of his favourites. I love how 2 sprays last and last, even through the next day and a shower. This is the perfect fragrance for Autumn. Will definitely repurchase.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,Was really excited and nervous to try this fragrance. I have heard many positive and many negative things. I love it! It almost could be unisex fragrance it's not super over the top feminine. It's a very interesting fragrance! Get a sample before you commit to buy.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"This is my ALL time absolute favorite perfume! It's so complex,so different than anything else out there! I don't know which comes first…you fall in love with it or it falls in love with you!! It's that great ! I will never be with Angel! Not for everyone , but for the ones who love Angel. We know what a gem it truly is. Thank you, Thierry Mugler!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I actually came across this by accident, but I'm so glad I did. I found a random sample in something I bought, tried it out, and fell in love. It's so simple and sexy but unique at the same time. If you're into a feminine, sexy, slightly musky scent this one's for you. I've used up about 4 trial size bottles and I'm about to buy the real thing!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"There aren't enough words to describe how much I love this scent. In my search for a signature, this is easily the one that has come the closest. Everything is just in perfect balance with this one.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,I don't like this. It's pretty stinky.,1,Sephora,us
Angel,"This is the weirdest perfume I've ever bought, but my new signature scent. I got a sample of it and when I first sprayed it I thought it stunk. But it dissolves into this beautiful, weird smell; I couldn't decide if I loved it or completely hated it, but when I ran out of the sample all I could think about was how I wanted to smell it again!! Needless to say I went and bought the bottle and I can't get over how much I love it. Also, first perfume I've ever bought that literally lasts all day. Worth the price tag!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"i received a sample of this and it is a very strong perfume. it definitely isn't the kind of perfume to spray and walk through, but it smells nice when applied to the base of your neck. i wear this layered with dior's j'adore and it smells amazing.",4,Sephora,us
Angel,"Got this as a sample with my purchase. At first when I put it on the scent was overwhelming that I thought it was a cologne lol. Maybe five mins later, it became subtle and it smelled absolutely amazing throughout the day. I fell in love with it because the smell is really warm and very appealing.",4,Sephora,us
Angel,"I chose this as a free sample with a previous purchase and I immediately fell in love with this scent. It's very ""warm"" and woodsy but still has that touch of femininity to it. I think I don't have an issue with the scent because I like patchouli. If you don't, this might not be the perfume for you. I love it so much that I bought a full sized bottle. I'd most likely wear this at night moreso than during the day.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I am not a fan of Thierry Mugler 's Angel. It's a shame because online the description says notes of :Bergamot, Hedione, Helional, Honey, Dewberry, Red Berries, Vanilla, Caramel, Patchouli, Chocolate, Coumari. I love most of the notes found. I think its very strong once you apply the fragrance but then it becomes more subtle. I do have to admit the scent does last all day.",1,Sephora,us
Angel,Super strong and does not smell pleasant at all. I received a sample of this from Sephora.... oh geez. Lol,1,Sephora,us
Angel,"I got this as a sample and I ended up buying a big bottle bottle because it's absolutely amazing. It starts off spicy with a delicate sweetness to it, then when it dries it smells like a decadent chocolate desert. It lasts all day but it's not overwhelming. The only downside is that it's kinda pricey so I would suggest getting a sample first and trying it before you buy because it isn't going to smell the same on everyone.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I had been wanting to try this for a while so I picked up the rollerball. I have to say that I absolutely hated this at first, like I really wanted it off of me, but after somewhere between 30-45 minutes things changed. I spayed it one single time and it was overwhelming, but after it settled it started to smell good, like vanilla, musk, honey, caramel and patchouli. I like the scent especially for fall and winter. This is definitely one very highly concentrated perfume, the strongest that I have ever come across so you really only need a tiny bit, I'm talking like one little spritz of it and then give it 30-45 minutes to settle (I know seriously a major pain), but once it is on and has settled it will last you for the whole entire day. This perfume will definitely last you forever since you really do need such a tiny amount, I'll probably have my rollerball for more than a year before it needs replaced (I do wear several other fragrances) so I guess that is a positive thing. So overall I do like it, I like the scent, but only when it's applied in a very small amount and is given plenty of time to settle. I definitely recommend that you try this one before buying a full size bottle. Just a side note... under style it says ""soft""... I don't know how this could ever be described as soft.",4,Sephora,us
Angel,at first kinda is strong but after it settles after few seconds it smells amazing i love it im so getting it for Christmas,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"This smells like bug-spray mixed with extra strong body odour. Nothing about this good, nothing.",1,Sephora,us
Angel,"I don't think I've ever smelled a ""bad perfume in sephora"" they all smell really nice so when I received a sample from sephora of this I was expecting it to smell nice too but wow I was wrong. It's a strong smell and it smells like a spray you would spray on bugs (I swear). Not sure why maybe it's my body chemistry but no other perfume has ever smelt bad on me also this made me really noxious!!! Would never recommend.",1,Sephora,us
Angel,"I am DYING laughing while reading some of these reviews. Body chemistry changes every scent so you have to choose one that works for you. If you are silly enough to purchase an expensive fragrance without trying it on first, that's your fault. I love Chanel No. 5 on others but it smells like bug spray on me. However, I would never in a MILLION YEARS come on the internet and write a bad review of Chanel No. 5. All Thierry Mugler fragrances (men and women) are strong and last a while. I always get compliments on this one but JUST LIKE EVERY OTHER FRAGRANCE ON THE MARKET you have to try it on to see how it works for you.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,I received a sample with purchase. I personally find this perfume absolutely awful. It would NOT go away once it was on and smelled horrid on my skin.,1,Sephora,us
Angel,"I received this as a free sample and accidentally sprayed it on my hand instead of the card to sample smell it. On the plus side, it has lasted at least 6 hours through multiple hand washes and hand sanitizers. On the negative side, it has lasted. I read a review that said to not trust the people who say it smells like bug spray, I guess no one should trust me then bc that is EXACTLY what it smells like. Actually, I might like actual bug spray scent better. I would definitely say this is a try before you buy kind of perfume!",1,Sephora,us
Angel,"This perfume is so weird, but in a good way. I got a sample of it with my last order and when I first sprayed it I gagged and thought it was disgusting. I made the mistake of spraying it on myself, and really wanted to kick myself for that.

HOWEVER. Later after the initial spray died down, and I was relaxing, I caught a whiff of my clothing and I loved the smell. But the Angel perfume was the only thing I had sprayed on. I had my boyfriend smell it and he liked it as well. It was a very warm, patchouli, yet sweet scent. Very earthy and perfect for Fall/Winter. Reminds me a lot of the Lush's Karma soap. If at first spray you hate it, give it a chance! It is very concentrated and just needs to hang out with your skin chemistry for a bit to give off its real smell. Might purchase a full bottle!",4,Sephora,us
Angel,This has to be the worst fragrance I've come across for a women! I received this in my sample perfume bag and omg it was horrible that it had me gagging.,1,Sephora,us
Angel,"I absolutely love this fragrance, and have received numerous compliments on how good I smell while wearing it. It is definitely one that you either love or hate. I'm glad I LOVE IT!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"Love it!

Angel,"While I wanted to love this, it isn't a highly original fragrance. It is beautiful, but also very strong. I would encourage the discerning nose to disregard the ""bug spray"" reviews and note that this is a sophisticated fragrance (like all of Thierry Mugler's fragrances), and isn't for everyone. I love Alien, but this one just didn't sit right on my skin.",3,Sephora,us
Angel,"I've never felt compelled to write a product review before trying this perfume. This smells like straight bug spray, and doesn't have the added benefit of fending off bugs.",1,Sephora,us
Angel,I really don't like this scent at all. I don't know what else to say. It just doesn't work for me,1,Sephora,us
Angel,"It really depends on your body chemistry when it comes to this perfume (that's with any scent). On me, it smelled like horrible BO! But I've smelled it on others and the scent wasn't too bad. Very strong long lasting scent. Try before you buy it! you'll either love it or hate...there's no in between with this one.",1,Sephora,us
Angel,"I received a sample of this perfume and loved it. It is now one of my favorites. For anyone who doesn't want their Angel, I will gladly take it off of your hands! : )",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I rarely wear scent of any kind but was shopping and walked by a lady twice and the 2nd time I asked her what she was wearing, I bought some and I love it. It is a little strong at first but within 15 minutes it is clean and mystical. GREAT for me",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"When I first sprayed this, I couldn't tell if I liked it or not. I smelled like old potpourri initially, which I was not happy about. However this perfume changes scent as it dries down, it smells very warm, earthy, and like caramel. It's a very different smell and has become my favorite. If you spray it on and hate it, just give it an hour and the scent should change. Oh and btw, it lasts ALL day. No joke, this stuff has some serious staying power.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"Someone gave this to me as a gift, and the packaging is beautiful and easily one of my favorites from a design perspective. But one spray, whether it's on myself or a piece of tissue, basically sets off a scent EXPLOSION. I'm all for perfumes that are long lasting, but when the sent is so overwhelming, I can't imagine ever wearing this out in public. My bathroom reeked of this for an entire day from just one spray. Definitely can't recommend this scent.",1,Sephora,us
Angel,"You either love this perfume, or hate it. I normally like sweet gourmand/edible type fragrances, and Angel is described as a gourmand...however I found this fragrance to be too strong and there was a note in it which I strongly disliked..I can't figure out what it is. Definitely sample it in store before buying.",2,Sephora,us
Angel,"This perfume has the worst smell I've ever encountered in my life. The sales clerk at Sephora told me that a lot of older women liked it, but even so, I cannot comprehend why. I made the mistake of spraying it on myself instead of using the tester strips to smell it, and I immediately regretted it. My nose is not usually sensitive to any particular smells, but the smell of this made me want to throw up. I tried to cover it up with another perfume but it still reeked, so if you want staying power, I commend this perfume in that sense. Smells horrible and I won't be able to stand beside anyone who smells of this perfume.",1,Sephora,us
Angel,"One of my least favorite perfume smell ever. It's terrible, the smell makes me nauseous.",1,Sephora,us
Angel,"It opens with a very STRONG patchouli on me. It is one of the few perfumes that I wanted to wash off when I sprayed it. Really dislike it. As the hours pass it settles and turns more into the vanilla/caramel which is better, but still I would never put it on again",1,Sephora,us
Angel,I looove this fragance! My only complain is the fragance doesnt stay too much on me =(. Everybody says the fragance stays long way on the skin but thats not my situation nevertheless I just have to put the perfume on frecuently because I love the smell,4,Sephora,us
Angel,"I love this scent it is one of my longest running favorites and has become a signature scent for me. I reach for it when i want comfort, sexy and strong confidence for those important meetings but it also is a delectable scent perfect for a sexy date night. Caution, A little goes a long way so I would definitty test out with a sample to know if it is right for you. The scent will also intensify with body heat so keep that in mind if you are prone to hot flashes. My only complaint is that the travel size is not a roller ball but a spray. I would much prefer a roller ball for my purse and won't repurchase the travel spray.",4,Sephora,us
Angel,"This scent didn't work on my skin. All I get is mega patchouli or something quite sharp. I don't get any chocolate or vanilla, mostly something's soapy and almost fabreeze-like. I had a sample. I've heard it's one you either love or hate, it's too bad it didn't work for me. Oh well!",1,Sephora,us
Angel,I absolutely adore this perfume. It's complex and amazing. One spray lasts all day. Worth every cent.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,I've been wearing this scent for a few years now and ALWAYS get compliments. One spray goes a long way. Definitely worth the price.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I've written reviews for a lot of fragrances and with maybe one exception I don't think I've ever given a fragrance less than 3 stars, but I just can't believe how bad this one smells on me! Perhaps it's my body chemistry? All I can smell is the chocolate, the coumarin, and a super spicy but artificial chemically pepper sort of smell that overwhelms everything else. Looking at the list of notes, I was expecting to love it: red berries, Bergamot, Vanilla, Honey, but I just can't smell any of that at all! So my advice is that you should definitely, DEFINITELY sample this perfume to see how it works with your body chemistry before you spend any money on it at all, just in case you find it as foul as I do. But I must concede this: this fragrance is VERY long lasting. It will last for hours, even if you try to wash it off, so use it sparingly.",1,Sephora,us
Angel,"Went on smelling a lot like Jean Nate, so I was already non-plussed with the scent. After a few hours the scent matured into what smells like a combination of Raid bug spray and baby powder. Maybe it's my skin chemistry, but this smells horrible.",1,Sephora,us
Angel,"I love Thierry Mugler fragrances, including this one. I""m sad I have to give it a poor review. It's not because of the fragrance itself, it's because the decanter is defective. It's sold as a travel spray however it is so fragile that it shattered within 24 hours in my purse. My bag smells great, and lucky for me it didn't wet my phone, but what a waste! Adding insult to injury, when I contacted Sephora (usually great customer service) and explained the defect they responded they could not replace the item as it didn't break during shipping.
If you like this parfum maybe try a larger size in a less fragile bottle, or just don't expect to use it as recommended (that is don't try carrying it in your bag). I'm sooooo disappointed!",1,Sephora,us
Angel,"This did NOT smell like it did in the store when I tried it, nor did it smell like magazine samples. I was looking forward to getting a bottle of Angel, and very disappointed in the horrid smell of it. Dare I say, just a squirt was unpleasantly strong, like a urinal or sweaty locker room. I tried to wash it off, and the awful smell is still on me. Why oh why does it smell like it's gone off?! Returning this 15ml bottle asap. Sad.",1,Sephora,us
Angel,"I received this as a sample and was really excited to try this it after reading reviews. I can see why people would like this: it's warm, lush, and sweet. I'm a fan of sweet--but not cloying scents--like some musky vanillas. I thought that this might fall into that category, since I was intrigued by the idea of a perfume that described as smelling like caramel and chocolate. However, this did not work well with my skin/natural chemistry. I imagine that if i had received this as a roller ball and could control how much ended up on my skin, I may have liked it more. But, it was too powdery for my taste and very, very sweet.

As a plus, I will say that it does have staying power in a way that some perfumes do not. This is going to sound like a backhanded compliment, but it took me a few intense handwashes to get the scent off of me. This is normally a plus for me, since I dislike having to re-apply perfume throughout the day. So, if this scent had worked for me, it would have been ace. No go, though. NBD.",2,Sephora,us
Angel,"2 for 2 - I specifically asked for a ""roller ball"" and was given this! It was not until I got home that I realized that it was a spray. It wouldn't have been so bad, if I hadn't actually specifically asked.",1,Sephora,us
Angel,"My mom sent me sample sprays years ago, this was one of them. I was hooked and everyone always compliments me and said they love the smell. So it's my fragrance of choice. I have several bottles, gift sets and it's nice when people just come up to you saying they love the perfume. I buy it when others realize they don't like it. Its definitely something that either you can or can't wear it type fragrance.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"Definitely a perfume that is directly dependent on body chemistry -- it'll be hypnotically pleasant on some people, & absolutely horrible on other people. It smelled like patchouli and muddy chocolate pudding on me. Awful. I couldn't wash the stench off fast enough. I smelled like what I imagined a stereotypical pot-smoking, non-showering, hippie who attended Woodstock '69 would've smelled like. All that was missing was burning a stick of nag champa incense. I HIGHLY recommend that you get a free sample like I did to test it out before you buy a bottle -- what you sniff from the bottle won't be what emits from your skin. The only positive about this perfume is the convenient refillable feature of the bottle.",1,Sephora,us
Angel,"In the fragrance world, Angel was definitely a trailblazer. It is a beautiful and complex gourmand fragrance, and I absolutely HATE IT.
It is just one of those love or hate fragrances, and it wears differently on everyone. I got a sample to wear for a few days, and was out with a friend, and she was wearing it also and I didn't even recognize it. It smelled amazing on her, but turned into some kind of chocolate patchouli monster on me.",4,Sephora,us
Angel,"I am waiting for you to contact me at pamelaclayton@yahoo.com. I will gladly take your bottle of Angel off of your hands.

It is fascinating how some of us love it and some notsomuch. Lol

Love it!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"Angle is a fragrance like no other. It's beautiful on so many levels... It begins a little sweet and the lasting notes are gorgeous. A feminine yet earthy version of patchouli that men and women alike compliment me on. The refillable star is definitely worth it. I worked in fragrance for a couple years and it was a best seller. Even though a lot of women wear this fragrance, it smells unique to each person.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"this perfume is so amazing, its my go to perfume!!! one spray and you smell wonderful! its long lasting, which is good if youre a girl and dont alway want to carry a perfume with you !!!!!!! i love itt!!! ! i always buy a bottle !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"smell is subjective, but I found this to be quite intriguing and very pleasant. I loved it a lot actually. Between this and Alien, I lean slightly more towards Angel, but they are both exceptional perfumes. If you like delicat and barely there scents, this might not be for you, but if you are on the bold side, you will probab",5,Sephora,us
Angel,Smells like cologne..if anything try the .23fl,1,Sephora,us
Angel,"My boyfriends mom gave me a small sample spray vial of this. When i sprayed it on me, i was taken aback on how strong this is, so only one or two sprays should suffice. Its not my ideal scent but when it dries down it smells sweet and sexy. Boyfriend likes it too.",4,Sephora,us
Angel,It's s really nice bottle n really cute bc it's so small n with just a few sprays it stays on ALL DAY,5,Sephora,us
Angel,really like this perfume I'm not a big fan of perfume in general but this is really nice & subtle,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"There are not enough adjectives to describe how awful this perfume is! I sprayed it on and almost died. I can't describe the horror that permeated my nose. I had to change my clothes and take a bath. I wanted to rip my arm off. To my chargrin, my whole laundry basket now smells like this scent. I tried it again a few days to be fair and still hideous. I don't know why this is so popular! If you like it I will mail you my bottle!! I think it should have a hazard label. Use at your own risk! Lol",1,Sephora,us
Angel,"This is quite literally the worst perfume I've ever smelled in my entire life.
It smells like very bad mens cologne.",1,Sephora,us
Angel,"Sexy, perfect scent for a first date or for casual nights out.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,Wanted to love it. Some of the notes smell really good but there is something in it that I just didn't like. Ended up returning it.,2,Sephora,us
Angel,"... it wears me! I really want to love Angel; I'm a huge fan of Alien, I know this was really popular in the 90's, ""oriental gourmand"" sounds like such an amazing combo, and the bottle is so pretty. I was so intrigued by the idea of this perfume, but geez louise, it is so strong. And I don't shy away from strong perfume! But Angel is so ... weirdly dirty, from the patchouli, I guess, and weirdly sticky-smelling, from the chocolate and honey, and just, I don't know, weird. I kind of like it and am kind of repulsed and horrified by it. A lot of perfume will start loud and settle down on your skin after a while, but not this puppy. It's not a gentle guardian angel, it's the scary kind with the flaming sword that comes down from heaven to destroy cities.",3,Sephora,us
Angel,"Angel is a VERY concentrated fragrance, so use one spray, seriously.  It lasts all day and into the night.  This is a very powerful and unique scent that you either love or hate.  I love it.  I cannot stress strongly enough that one tiny spritz will be plenty for your whole body and will last all day.  I spray it on my tummy, so others can enjoy it, but it's not too close to my nose.  This is a more subtle way of wearing it.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,this smells wonderful. I get so many compliments.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,I don't get the hype over this perfume. It's the most disgusting perfume I have ever smelled. I got it as a gift and I had to return it. I wore it one time and that was enough for me. I had to endure for an entire day and I was so ready to go home and wash it off. It smells hornedeous.,1,Sephora,us
Angel,I've been wearing Angel since about 1999. I've often tried new scents just for a change but this is the one I always go back to. I never get tired of it. I've been asked countless times 'what are you wearing? It smells amazing!' and I've also noticed MEN LOVE THIS SCENT. They just do. Trust me. I feel feminine and sexy when I wear it but I also can wear it during the day or to work without it feeling overpowering or heavy. It's my absolute all-time favorite.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"Love, love, love it!!! Go for it and you won't regret it. If you don't like it then send it to me ;-)",5,Sephora,us
Angel,This smells like my kids clothes after playing football. I had a sample and sprayed it all over and was so disgusted I had to change clothes and wipe my body down.,1,Sephora,us
Angel,"I was intrigued by this fragrance based upon the notes listed. Who wouldnt want to smell like chocolate? Anyway, i spritzed this on my wrist and went home to see how it would develop over time. All I could smell was funky melon coated in nuts and rolled in cotton candy. Where was the chocolate? ?? After two hours, turned into a hot patchouli mess. My husband told me I had to take another shower because this stuff smelled so bad, he wouldn't allow me to go to bed smelling like the ""angel of death"". Very heavy, permeates every drop of air in every room you enter. Strange name for a fragrance that is not delicate or soft as you would imagine an angel to be!!!",1,Sephora,us
Angel,"Not saying that old ladies stink, but this smells like the typical ""old lady perfume."" It wasn't strong, but very heavy-smells very peppery, spicy. It definitely lingers. Had to return this one.",1,Sephora,us
Angel,"I first tried this at the sephora in my mall because the beauty associate sprayed some on my hand, she got the surprise of her life when I almost ran out of the store in fear of almost puking everywhere! This smells so rotten and I'm a nurse so I come across bad odors all day, none of those smells compared to what I smelled with this perfume! Steering clear of this one for good! Alien is much MUCH better!",1,Sephora,us
Angel,"I'm a perfume fanatic and Angel is, without a doubt THE BEST. I get compliments on it ALL the time, and one of the guys at work wanted me to write down the name so he could buy it for his women (daughters and current girlfriend). I have the full size bottle, but I keep the travel size tubes in my overnight/carry on bags.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"This perfume made me gag several times before it started to grow on me. For me the biggest turn off is the patchouli. I generally like heady perfumes and I honestly like patchouli, but for some reason, on my skin patchouli becomes so loud and obnoxious its offensive. Yet I keep trying this out and manage to receive compliments. I find out that this perfume is not to be sniffed right after sprayed on, at least not by my own nose. Usually after 20 minutes in the patchouli tones down and it smells better and better. I want to say that my favorite perfumes are the Alien and Gucci guilty black, both of which are straight heaven for me, yet somehow I can't stop reaching for Angel everyday and ignore the others.",4,Sephora,us
Angel,"Thierry Mugler seems to always offend me, and then ends up growing on me.

It has holding power, and is totally worth purchasing, as you only need 1-2 squirts. Dry-off seems to smell about the same.

Angel is very musky to me - very different. It claims to be ""foody,"" although I don't detect anything like that. It's a different smell that is very memorable.

I bought the refillable bottle, as you can get a discount if you take it back into the store.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,I am obsessed with Angel! It is such a amazing sent its all i think about. I get so many complement and questions on what sent im wearing.when i put it on through out the entire day !,5,Sephora,us
Angel,I love this fragrents.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,I wanted to like this perfume considering I was given a free sample of it along with my online purchase. It is very strong and not feminine or innocent as it claims to be. With another attempt to like this perfume I asked my boyfriend what he thought and he said it smells masculine. It reminded him of something his father wears. Definitely not a turn on!,1,Sephora,us
Angel,"I'm so glad that some people don't like this. If we all did we'd all be walking around wearing Angel. Though, really what is not to love...the bottle is gorgeous, I feel special just picking it up. At first whiff it's a little much, goes on heavy but wait for that drydown...it's worth it. If you try this..by all means give the scent time to develop, all good perfumes require time..I see a lot of people in stores smelling stuff and immediately deciding if they like it or not....So my advice walk around in this for a day, then decide.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I just like the way it smells, it makes me feel confident when I go out wearing it.",4,Sephora,us
Angel,"I received Angel as a gift over 10 years ago and instantly fell in love with it. I always get asked what I am wearing. I find that it is a better fall/winter fragrance as it smells warm, sexy, caramel, chocolaty. I definitely think it is polarizing in that you either love it or hate it. I really love it and it lasts forever. I can still smell it after a long day.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"Luv, Luv, Luv this scent from the time i first encountered it in the perfume aisle....scent lingers--smells divine!!!
Just Say'in!!!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I am picky about perfume. Florals give me headaches and it's hard to find spicy scents that aren't manly. An associate recommended Angel and it's perfect. I keep a rollerball in the car and my purse to freshen up. I love the smell, try it. It's also a refillable star that you can refill at a discount in store.",4,Sephora,us
Angel,"I wanted to like this perfume because it sounded great, but it smelled horrible on me, like old expired swampy bug spray, and gave me an instant headache. I had to wash it off right away. Definitely not angelic. Try before you buy this one!",1,Sephora,us
Angel,"I bought this scent because I was following a coworker around, asking her what smelled so good. She gave up the secret and I have been hooked on this magic elixir ever since. That was 14 years ago. Now people follow me around, saying ""dang, why do you smell so good?"" totally worth it.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,i always get compliments when i wear this perfume!! People out of the blue tell me how great I smell! It's well worth every penny!!,5,Sephora,us
Angel,Very unique sent. Invigorating. On my third bottle already,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"Not for me. I had the sample and just couldn't get past the smell in the sample bottle then I heard a review on you tube on their thoughts then I thought it would smell different on the skin, nope. I tried washing it off and spraying better fragrance over it and it still over powered... just can't handle that scent",1,Sephora,us
Angel,"This fragrance smells like a Baby Boomer man. There is nothing dreamy or feminine about this at all. It is very strong, stinky, and generic. So, I guess the description is true about evoking childhood memories, because it did make me think of my dad. His smell just wasn't one of his more admirable qualities, LOL!",1,Sephora,us
Angel,"i absolutely HATE the scent of this
i know that this one in particular is either love or hate and i really really do not like this
smells so gross on and even in the bottle.
do not like by any means",1,Sephora,us
Angel,"I've heard such great things about this perfume. But, I cannot stand the smell. Perhaps it's because I'm sensitive to smell, but ohmygoodness, this smelled TERRIBLE!! Alien by Thierry Mugler didn't smell any better! Yucky, yucky, yucky! It smells stinky. There really isn't another way to put it. It smells stinky. Although fragrance smells different on different skins, I didn't like it on anyone or myself. It's a hit or miss with this one. Some people absolutely love it & some people (like myself) feel nauseated with the scent. To me, it smells like a mix of the cleaner Formula 409 & some type of tea. This is just one of those perfumes where you have to go to Sephora & smell it for yourself - don't base it off of review.",1,Sephora,us
Angel,"Angel is one of those rare finds that is so extreme it draws very extreme reactions: you either love this scent or really, really hate it. Luckily, I LOVE it! For me, the patchouli is breathtakingly strong at first whiff, but then I'm hit with a beautiful blend of honey, berries, chocolate, and sweet vanilla. All of these notes create the most unique scent I've ever smelled. This is a very warm, sexy scent that seems so classy to me, and the star bottle is just gorgeous. So far I've loved every Mugler scent I've smelled and they always last for 8+ hours on my skin, so I'd definitely recommend this to all.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"i was really excited to try this perfume, heard so many great things about it...unfortunately i absolutely disliked it! it was VERY OVERPOWERING! i tried to spray a slight hint even, and still too powerful. i would say that its a perfume that i would recommend to wear in the evening, but even the scent of it was not complimentary at all!!! it honestly made me feel verrrrryyyy nauseated...the only way i can describe this scent is as...UGH! not the least bit pleasant.",1,Sephora,us
Angel,This one is interesting! I get more compliments when I wear this than any other perfume I own! Seems to last all day!,4,Sephora,us
Angel,Soft scent. Not overpowering at all. Lasts all day. Sexy.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,My coworker wears this and she always smells so amazing. Now I have it and I can't stop smelling myself. Only thing is it's very expensive. $150 for a 3.4 oz?,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I'm not a fan of the super sweet scents. This perfect has a scent that is so uncharacteristic.. It is not sweet but not too masculine, if you will. I only use 1 spray on my neck then dab my wrists in it, and it lasts the entire day. I wore it to the lake and everyone (literally) asked me what I was wearing because it smelled so nice. The smell of this perfume *is* different *on* you vs. on a tester (it's a more natural smell vs when you immediately spray it out of the bottle) and it does lessen with time. I was hesitant about buying it at first. I ended up getting the refillable large perfume when it first came out about 1.5 years ago and it's still at least half full. I've definitely gotten my money's worth.

All in all, I'd recommend this to anyone, but especially fans of Burberry for women.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,I would try this on in the store and wear it for a few hours before you buy it! The scent changes within about an hour. It is pretty pungent at first. It is definitely more mature. It's my new favorite scent. I wear to bed every night and when I wake up I can still smell it.,4,Sephora,us
Angel,The smell is too strong and not that great at all. I cant even describe how awful it is. It gives off the aroma of expired old lady perfume found in the garbage.. You just have to get a whiff yourself. Bleh.,1,Sephora,us
Angel,Totally not for me. It's very strong. Good thing for people that do like it- it lasted all day.,2,Sephora,us
Angel,"This is a very strong scent for a woman. To me it smells like root beer, black licorice and cheap baby powder. Awful. It does last a long time so I'll give it 2 stars for longevity.",2,Sephora,us
Angel,"Hands down ANGEL Is an amazing scen sandlewood , vanilla , amber , musk , and chocolate fuse so well together as well as last for 1 sometimes multiple days lingering luxuriousl in fabrics or in hair",5,Sephora,us
Angel,This is my signature scent. my holy grail a must have that smells all day long on me.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,I truly enjoy wearing this scent. It's staying power is remarkable and smells different than any other scents.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"Love it and a MUST have. It's elegant, classy and too over bearing but stands out.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"The first time I smelled this perfume, I was 15 in my local sephora. And guess what? I hated it! Flash forward and I'm 20 years old, and now can't function without a squirt of this on me. Why the change of heart? What I'm assuming is a body chemistry change ala puberty made it actually smell good on me. So my advice is to try it on you before you buy, it's going to smell different on everyone. I love the way it smells? To me I get more spicy honey-vanilla scent then anything else but then again when I first smelled it, it was straight patchouli smelling. This perfume is a classic, and if you like it, then buy it. It smells like the classy girl at the bar who sips a whisky all night and turns down every boy. I would recommend this to everyone.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"A few spritz of this EDP will do.

I used about 4 sprays of this on my jacket to work one day and the whole office smelled like me ALL day, it was awkward. It was obviously pretty strong because I can smell my jacket hanging from my office chair from the other end of the office hallway. The perfuming body lotion smells very nice and I get compliments ALL the time. However, the EDP is quite intense. It definitely lasts a long time.",4,Sephora,us
Angel,"This does smell great and stays on for long periods of time (ESPECIALLY clothing), beware - this stuff is POTENT. One spritz is all you need and I would even suggest applying it outdoors, if possible.",3,Sephora,us
Angel,"To me, this fragrance smells anything but soft and angelic like I was expecting. It smells more like a cologne and is definitely something I would not wear.",1,Sephora,us
Angel,"I really love this perfume. I don't wear this during the warm weather months; I feel like it's more of a winter scent. It's extremely heavy and a little goes a long way, IMO.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"This isn't for everyone. It's a scent that really smells totally different on ppl. It has hints of various flowers (like lily of the valley and Jasmine), coconut, melon, vanilla, chocolate, patchuli etc... it works for me. I also find it doesn't fade on me as others say. If you like the smell out of the bottle but don’t like it on you, I recommend Jean Paul Goultier original. ..",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I received a sample of this and was not impressed. It smelled musky (in a bad way) and was not a smell I enjoyed. I can smell some of the chocolate-y hints toward the end of the smell, but it has this almost ""man-like"" scent right up front. I gave it two stars because it is an interesting smell and I am sure there are those that love this. I won't be purchasing this one though.",2,Sephora,us
Angel,I was expecting something radically different based on the description and reviews... for some reason it just came off as a rancid/rotting scent on me. Not cute. :(,2,Sephora,us
Angel,"I loved this fragrance for the first hour. Was sexy and slightly grapefruit, with a hint of chocolate. But after an hour turns patchouli scented, and thats not the scent for me.",3,Sephora,us
Angel,"I have this and the EDT, and I definitely prefer the EDT. This scent has a strong patchouli scent that I don't really like. It's still wearable, but I don't get the chocolate-y smell either. I find that if it's too strong, you can dab a little off with tissue right when you spray it.",3,Sephora,us
Angel,"This is an all around yummy fragrance without being too candy coated and young. Its a more grown up kind of sweet, like a chocolate martini. Men really love this I must say. And so do I. It has depth and complexity but it stays sweet all the way through.",4,Sephora,us
Angel,"i don't know what half of the ""notes"" are as described in the scent...i mean, what's a helional? but i don't have to know, because this fragrance truly is heavenly. i can't get enough of it and i get compliments every time i wear it. light enough that it's not overpowering but strong enough that you don't feel as though the scent is gone by lunchtime. also the hair perfume is great!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I have been wearing Angel for almost 20 years and it's hands-down my absolute favorite fragrance (obviously). I have always received compliments on Angel. To me, the sign of a great fragrance is one that you put on and can no longer smell after a short time. This is that fragrance for me. Fresh, crisp, sexy and light.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,The scent lasts all day. It's such a warm fragrance it makes me happy.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"Once every two months or so, my body chemistry is just right for this perfume. It smells amazing on me in the summer - like one night stands, coffee and chocolate...wild. But in the Fall, Winter, and Spring, this perfume makes me smell like an old man with massive B.O. - lt makes me smell dirty - like that sharp armpit musk. I probably won't buy it again because it will last me until I die.",2,Sephora,us
Angel,"I bought a small bottle of this because it was one of the editors picks. It wasn't for me. I don't want to bash the fragrance because I thought it smelled good and it is a very good quality. I gave it to a co-worker and his wife loves it.
Just didn't go with my body chemistry.",3,Sephora,us
Angel,I love love love my angel since it first came out!!!! Everyone loves to smell it on me and the daily complements keep on rolling!!!!,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"i endlessly receive compliments when i wear this scent. It has a sexiness to it, a slight warmth, &chocolate undertones. This one is a keeper for me.
The secret: must wear it "" lightly"".....",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I have been wearing Angel for over six years, and I continue to live it and buy new bottles and refills. I have converted two other ladies to wearing it, and I constantly get compliments on it from complete strangers. It is intoxicating.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"Who doesn't love Thiery Mugler?
Oh my te memories of such a heady fragrance.
I actually bought ""Angel"" for one of my girlfriends. She has been ""my"" angel and she adores this fragrance.
I love the heavy musky oriental notes and apparently she does too!",4,Sephora,us
Angel,"This is my 2nd favorite perfume ever, following only Thierry Mugler's Alien formula :). This perfume smells wonderfully different on everyone I've had try it. It lasts wonderfully, and I often can smell the base notes the next day w/out any reapplying the previous day. The formula seems to develop more throughout the day and goes through all the elements w/out smelling muddled at all. I truly cannot say enough about this wonderfully intriguing scent. You will be asked often what you're wearing and complimented daily so be prepared. Cannot rate this high enough. So excited to order the hair mist!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"Been wearing this for years. I love the refillable bottle. It's a little annoying that bottle doesn't stand, however the scent is so amazing, I'll let that issue slide. It's very strong, so if you're sensitive to strong perfume this is not for you.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I have been using this perfume since it first came out and have not grown tired of it. I might take a break from it for a couple of weeks but ALWAYS go back to this. I know most either love or hate it and it's not something you want to apply liberally...a little goes a long way. Beautiful, sexy, edgy...the perfect perfume in my humble opinion!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I been using this frangrance since it came on the market. I have found as of late, as I am over 10 years older, I now do a quick spray in the air and walk through it, back and forth.
Less intense( can be over powerful for some) and I still love it.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I LOVE this scent! I tried it about a year ago and hated it, but just recently smelled it on someone and just loved how classy and sophisticated is smelled. So, I gave it another chance and I just love it!! It has an unusual scent when sprayed on initially that I have grown to like and I really like the dry down. It smells soft and sophisticated and slightly edgy! Can't stop smelling myself when I'm wearing it!!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"People either love this scent or hate it! I HATED it at first because a lady at my job drowns herself in it! The perfume is too intese for that. I tried it from a sample that I received and FELL IN LOVE with it! It smells rich and inviting with my body chemistry. Try it on your skin, not but smelling hte bottle.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"Angel is an in-your-face oriental scent. While I imagine it is supposed to smell warm and inviting, I agree with poster who said it was cloying and slightly headache-inducing. What I get is patchouli and spices, paired with way too much sweetness.

This smells like the overpowering scents that were around my house in the 1980s. To illustrate:

When my mother went out, Aramis broke up with Shalimar. That's when TABU noticed her sitting on my mother's bureau and they got very drunk together and concieved a baby where I sprayed this perfume on my wrist. They named it Angel.

I'm not sure I understand the popularity of this fragrance, it's the Love's Baby Soft of the millenium.",1,Sephora,us
Angel,"Very strong, and sweet smelling and it sticks around forever. To me it smells powdery with chocolate undertones that gets stuck in your nostrils leading to a slight headache. It's just too much.",2,Sephora,us
Angel,"This is one of my favorite scents. It starts off a bit ""strong"" with woodsy scent but then softens into a sweeter airy scent...but not overly whelming ""sweet"". This is a scent that people will ask me what I'm wearing...",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I love this perfume. I've been wearing this for over 10 years and it is truly my signature scent. I always get compliments on this perfume and how it smells on me.

I was reading some of the negative comments and I shocked that so many people think this perfume is awful. I do think you need to try this on as with another perfume since perfumes smell different on everyone. It's all with your chemistry.

My friend would smell like hot chocolate and I have been told it smells like cotton candy on me.

The perfume is a great value for the price, when you get a refill the price is less than the original purchase price.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,One of the store associates introduced this item to me and I fell in love with it instantly!! It's bold and intense so a little goes a long way. I get so many compliments when I wear this fragrance!! The fragrance is not for everyone because it's deep and a little masculine. Try a sample next time you're in Sephora! The price is great if you buy the refillable bottle.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,I found this fragrance many years ago and it is the only one I wear.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I personally love this perfume. If you're just smelling it out of the bottle, it sometimes can be a little off-putting. But once you spray it on (I recommend a spray and not a rollerball), it is magical. It is a scent I would describe as ""haunting"". It really stays with you all day. I feel like such a woman when I wear this.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"Really did not like this fragrance. I tried it on and within a minute of sitting with my family, they began commenting on it--and not in a favorable way. The general consensus was that it smelled ""swampy"" and similar to a wet dog. The description sounded great but the actual product? Not so much. Stay far, far away!",1,Sephora,us
Angel,"Angel is by far the best perfume ever made! It's unique, it's super feminine, it's sexy, charming, makes me feel confident, powerful and stand out! If you don't want to be like someone else and smell like everyone, TRY ANGEL! A true miraculous scent... cannot get enough of it!!!!!!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I usually choose a floral fragrance but got a sample in the Sephora store. Love that you can ask for a sample before you buy the larger size! This purse size smells delicious and I am asked frequently what I am wearing...I want to keep it a secret, but it's too nice not to share. Will be purchasing the bigger size when I run out!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"It's a little pricey but, a little goes a long way! It is sweet and musky but not to musky! Always getting complements when I wear it.",4,Sephora,us
Angel,I cannot explain the infatuation that I have with Angel. Perhaps the advertisement tag line that this fragrance does evoke the emotion of childhood memories (not sure if that's it or not) but whenever I spray Angel on I am immediately in love.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,I wore this scent for years....all thru college and always got compliments. It now gives me a horrible headache. Too strong of a scent. I gave 3 stars b/c I still love to smell it on other people.,3,Sephora,us
Angel,"I love this perfume! It's a strong scent, a little goes a long way. After a day's work, I can still smell it on my skin, and it smells wonderful!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,This fragrance is sexy and long lasting!,5,Sephora,us
Angel,I love the scent and always make sure I have a new bottle for the Fall.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,I try out this perfume about once a year because I love complicated scents. Smells worse each time. Like cigarettes and baby powder.,1,Sephora,us
Angel,"I received a sample set of this product as a VIB reward. Out of the bottle and when initially applied, this stuff smells like Christmas, almost a pine-y scent. I thought I was crazy but my friend said the same thing when she checked it out. However, it quickly dries down to a sort of caramel/chocolate scent. I don't know much about perfume so I'm not going to try describing it further. I love wearing sweet scents and prior to this I had been using Pink Sugar by Aquolina, but I think that Angel has a bit more of a sophisticated sweetness that I appreciate. The hair perfume is excellent too.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I have a problem with most perfumes, since I am always so hot (and my temperature burns them away so fast!) but this one is a clear exception! Angel, despite having a patchouli undertone, that I'm not particularly fond or, is a beautiful, lasting scent! (I NEVER buy EDT, waste of money for someone like me!)",4,Sephora,us
Angel,"smells like a stinky man that just ate chocolate and rubbed peppers on his body. it's an awful patchouli overdose you can smell a mile a way. it isn't sweet or soft at all. it smells like this from the bottle and even worse on the skin. I bought this three years ago and hated it then and hate it now. I don't understand why people love such heady fragrances. if you want to actually smell like the notes this claims to have, seek out chocolovers by aquolina.",1,Sephora,us
Angel,I love the smell of angel. Women of all ages (several men too) approach me with compliments on the smell. I consider this a true testiment to its appeal!,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"When I went to sephora to tried out this perfume and the first time I spraying on the test paper to smell it...OMG this perfume make me want throw up, smell like cat urine. My daughter smell it and she said : Ewww!! Lol . But I like the Alien smell pretty good. Not recommend buy this perfume.",1,Sephora,us
Angel,"This scent is nowhere near ""soft and innocent"". It's very strong, bold and sensual. Whenever I wear it I can't stop smelling myself (this probably makes me look like a weirdo, but whatever) and I get tons of compliments. It starts out smelling spicy on me, and after awhile turns into a warm caramel/patchouli. A little goes a long way, and it still smells amazing at the end of the day! Definitely my favorite scent.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,This is my signature scent. I always get asked what fragrance do you wear and I love saying Angel!!! I adore this and it's simply the best!!!,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"Simply put it's one of two scents I keep going back to. I first tried it about two years ago and it did take a while to grow on me, but I soon became addicted.

Because it took so long to grow on me, I decided to wait and see whether I would like it after a few months. I still did want it afterwards, so I waited another few months. That soon became a year, and because I still couldn't stop wanting it, I knew this was THE perfume I needed.

It's the strongest one I have - I went out dancing one night with my girlfriends and I was the only one who still smelled the same once the night was over. Also, I've noticed it can withstand showers at times.

I think, to summarize, this is the only perfume I'd continue to buy over and over again.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"This perfume is otherworldly, sweetly unfolds into a musky sensual sent. I can be worn by either men or women, it all depends on the individual chemistry of the skin it is being applied to. I own the shooting star and only wear it when I feel indulgent, I chose this one over the man one because it smells fantastic on me in comparison to the man one that smells mediocre.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,The scent was not pleasant at all. It associates with an old crazy cat lady to me.,1,Sephora,us
Angel,"Not a very attractive scent... I don't know if they changed the sent from the last time I tried it (4 years ago) because it's getting a lot of good reviews and I think it smells a lot like a cologne, instead of a perfume... I thought it was one at first and gave it to my grandpa LOL",1,Sephora,us
Angel,ver sexy bu tonlu suitabe for fall/winter weather. can be strong,4,Sephora,us
Angel,Gorgeous scent and bottle!,5,Sephora,us
Angel,I can't believe I'm giving such a horrible review. Especially because the notes in this scent are everything I love. But I couldn't believe how horrible the smell was. I just tested it on my wrists and I had to send my shirt to the dry cleaners. It actually made me nauseated. The only thing I can liken it to was when I was 14 and this boy in cheap horrible cologne asked me to dance. There are so many beautiful fragrances. Please don't waste so much money on this one.,1,Sephora,us
Angel,"This is NOT light, sweet, and sexy. This is BAM in your face, unapologetic, rich, heady, and extremely sensual...I have yet to wear anything that even comes close, and I am a product junkie. Hard to describe , but it feels very RICH is the closest I can come...",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"Angel is not for the faint of heart. It is a heavy, dreamy, deliciously intoxicating ball of weirdness. It's listed as pure, soft and innocent and I couldn't disagree more. Spicy, memorable and powerful is more accurate.

This smells like heavy sexy cologne mashed up with patchouli sprinkled with chocolate. The chocolate aspect of the scent is very noticeable as is the patchouli. When you wear this scent it's all around you all day and people take notice. I'm a perfume head and this scent hands down gets the most compliments and complaints. I love to offend noses!

Along with compliments there is a strange sense of ""clubman-ship"" when I wear this. I've gotten nods from other Angel wearers when they walk past and smell it on me.

People who wear Angel are different. They are confident and they are fearless.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"But more often than not, it makes me literally nauseous. I like this on me and on others but it has to be just about to wear off. Very faint amounts. I had a great friend that always wore this and I would, well, gag, it's was embarrassing. Maybe I should try it again, because the patchouli in it is so wearable.",2,Sephora,us
Angel,"This will always and forever be my fragrance. I have tried to switch to other perfumes and have even tried the Sephora fragrance sampler, but STILL always come back to Angel. It is one of the few perfumes that people immediately identify and compliment. It has hints of patchouli, but reacts so perfectly with my body chemistry. It is expensive, but worth every penny. This is the only perfume that I have ever used (and I've had my fair share of samples and bottles) that when I unpack my fall and winter clothes, I can still smell Angel on them from a year ago. My mom and two sisters eventually got it because of how amazing it smells and it smells slightly different on each of them, but still so good. It is extremely easy to refill the star from the refill bottle as it even comes with a funnel. I always stick the used funnel in one of my clothes drawers after I fill it to keep the scent in there...obviously I am obsessed with this amazing perfume.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"This is my second favorite perfume after D&G Light Blue. It's sweet and sexy, it makes me feel happy when I wear it!! You should try it!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I heard a talk show host tell a guest how good she smelled and asked what fragrance she was wearing. Her reply was Angel so for months I have been thinking about trying to find Angel Parfum. I found it here and upon reading reviews almost talked myself out of buying this. But the desire to try it wouldn't leave me alone. So finally I bought it. And I can't for the life of me figure out why so many complained about this fragrance. I absolutely love this and I can see this being my only parfum for as long as I can find it. The only thing is it's expensive but to me that's a good thing because everyone that I meet won't be wearing it. This is a scent that's always been what I thought I wanted to smell like ,kind of warm and powdery. I hope Sephora always has this available to buy when I need more!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"This is my new favorite perfume. Wonderful. It is a bit overwhelming when you first spray it, but once it dries...omg! Love it!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I tested this on my wrists and really disliked it and washed it off. But, ofc it stays for hours heh. Then, for days I could smell feet. You know, feet that might have been in runners or something all day? Yeah, was this sample sitting on my desk. :S So strong and not pleasant. I do not get this perfume. Nope. Do not.

Read a tonne of reviews on another site and had to lol at the review that said it takes personality and character to wear this. What? To wear something 75% of the population is wearing? I don't think so. :) That is the antithesis of ""character"".

To those who have this on their skin and want it gone use pure cooking vinegar on the area. Rinse it off after and you will smell like vinegar but it also neutralizes the offending odor. Put something pleasant over top of it (anything Guerlain will do) and you are good to go. XD",1,Sephora,us
Angel,"A yummy, sexy scent.
I have the ""star"" bottle at home, and the slim travel spray in my gym bag.",4,Sephora,us
Angel,"I've been wearing this for many years. I do agree with some of the posts...like all perfumes, it's different on different people. I hate patchouli, and I can't smell that note in it when I wear it. I've received many complements over the years on it. If you love spicy, warm notes in your perfumes, you will love it. It's long lasting as well.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I really really hate this scent, of course it's my personal opinion but to me it smells like sweat mixed with something unpleasant, like toilet water. Not so yummy, it's most definitely unique in a gross way but I guess it works for other people seeing how popular it is. Try it out and hopefully it works with your body chemistry better than mine!",1,Sephora,us
Angel,My all time favorite. Smells wonderful even at the end of the day !! Tons of compliments.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"This perfume has been such a source of conflict for me over the past several years! I used to hate it with a passion...I really am not a fan of patchouli, and that was the only thing I could detect when I smelled it. But as I read more online about it (perfume blogs and such) I became curious and decided to give it another chance. So, I've had a little sample since last fall and at first I decided my original impression was correct - I was not a fan. However, I recently tried it again since we've been having a spell of cooler weather, and am now kind of obsessed with it. It really is enchanting, and even my husband asked me like 3 different times what perfume I was wearing (he specified he was asking because he liked it). Initially, it's just alright, but I like it much better 1-2 hours after it settles down a bit. I definitely detect the chocolate (which surprised me that I actually like it) and sweet (but not too sweet) cotton-candy-ish smell...but that sweetness is all evened out by the spiciness of the patchouli. It also lasts on your skin a looong time. So I have a feeling this will be my fall scent this year...warm, inviting, enchanting, and spicy. :)",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"this lasts all day, is spicy and sexy, men love it",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I tried the scent randomly maybe ten or more years ago, and I have loved it ever since! Its so different than any other scent I had used prior and have used since. While I do mix it up, because I don't wish to use all my precious ANGEL up too quickly..it is still the best! I get a scents of chocolate, caramel, and maybe a spicy addition also. It stays with me, feels warm and sensual. Intoxicating!!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I would strongly recommend trying this out at the store first. Put some on your wrist or whatever you're wearing (wherever you spray perfume) and see how you like it later.
It's totally dependent on your skin chemistry so it will smell different on everyone. On my skin it smells ghastly!!
I spray it in the air and walk through it so it's mostly on my clothes and it smells good but I probably wouldn't buy it again. In fact, the next person who says ""oh, you smell so good, what are you wearing?"" will get my bottle as a gift.",3,Sephora,us
Angel,"Lovely scent, not good value, bottle should be much larger for the price",4,Sephora,us
Angel,The most interesting perfume I've ever used. On me the most predominant note is honey. And I've read its won tons of awards.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"This a long lasting very chic perfume. I think you have to try it in-store to decide if you like it or not. It could be a bit strong for the younger ladies, less than 30 years old. It is definitely feminine and noticeable. The scent will change once it hits your skin. It is a very specific perfume for specific ladies. It is warm and spicy.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I could not wait to try this. It smells like Christmas when I first spray it on my skin. Only for a minute though. Then it changes and smells bad to me. Like it has a hint of urine, some cigarette smoke, and musk. After it's been on for a while, just before it fades, it smells rather good.",3,Sephora,us
Angel,"While it smells just like Boyfreind, it's not over-bearing",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"great...except I'd rather that the store refilled my refillable bottle (instead, their dispenser was broken).",4,Sephora,us
Angel,"I only use 2 different kinds of perfumes and this is one of them(the other is Alien)
Thierry Mugler makes AMAZING perfume!! Everywhere I go people always ask me what perfume am I wearing? And that I smell so good:) I also love how long lasting the scent is as well!!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I really love angel. I get so many compliments wearing this
fragrance. I love the varieties that have been created since the original in the early 1990's. THis angel is so celestial it lives up to its name. Such a dream to have!!!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"Can't get enough, so enchanting inviting yet mysterious.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"Every time I wear this scent, I always get compliments on it.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I tried my sample of Angel multiple times. I wore it around, not just sniffed it from the sprayer. I never liked it. Just a matter of personal taste. I won't ever buy it.",1,Sephora,us
Angel,I love Angel! I went from using Bang by Marc to using Noir by tom ford but on occasion I love using Angel. I also recommend the free kit. It's so addicting,5,Sephora,us
Angel,When I first spray this on I hate the smell but after it settles I really like it. If you're interested in this perfume spray it on something and if you don't care for that initial smell give it a little time you may find it smells better after 20 or 30 minutes like I did.,4,Sephora,us
Angel,Angel has a very clean and refreshing scent and I love the bottle.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"My boyfriend bought me this perfume for my birthday last year and at first it was okay but once it was on my skin and I started wearing it the more I loved it and so did everyone around me.
My mom has always worn Red, but this year for Mother's Day I decided to switch it up for her and I gifted her this. She really likes it and had the same conclusion as I did when I first came into contact with the perfume. I say YES buy it! =)",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I love having a purse-sized tube of my Angel Oerfume to carry around with me and freshen up my scent after a long day at work. Angel is my favourite fragrance. Feminine in a sensual way, it is a perfect balance of woodsy, musky and gourmand. As a person who searched for many years for a scent that was not irritatingly floral, too old and musky or too immature and fruity, I knew I had found perfection the first tine I smelled Angel.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,This perfume smells wonderful and last all day.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I'm so happy I bought this frangrance! Miguelina the associate at the NewPort Center, NJ Sephora was nice enought to tell me about a promotion they were having and I was able to snacth this wonderful fragrance at a steal of a price. NOW I'm hooked. Please go into your local Sephora and ask for a sample its free! try it and I'm sure you will be hooked too. now about the fragrance- It smells like heaven in a bottle its soft but powerful, sweet and sassy, it makes me feel grown and sexy and elegant. what more can you ask from a fragrance?",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"The best perfume ever, if you are someone that dress with class and sexy this is a perfect fragrance. Very harmonic notes and unforgettable smell.
Angel is the best.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I love Angel, it is one of my signature scents. I always receive compliments when I wear it. I will say though, this is one of those scents that wears differently on everyone who wears it. On some it can be too heavy and overpowering, but it blends very well with my body chemistry. It lasts all day, which I find to be rare for most perfumes. It is a very musky smell, with strong notes of patchouli. If you like lighter scents, this is not for you. I have been wearing it for years. Some say it's more appropriate at night but I do wear it during the day sometimes too. Definitely makes a statement.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I mostly smell patchouli when I wear it.
I like the light scent and that it didn't give me a headache.
What I didn't like was that it didn't last all day.",4,Sephora,us
Angel,Best perfume ever. Long lasting. I am always receiving compliments.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,Alien is so much better. Returned this item.,1,Sephora,us
Angel,I'm not really sure how to review a scent. I do know that this seems to fit my every mood & I love that it's refillable.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,Love this and get lots of compliments.. one spray is enough to last most of the day!,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I tried this on a date night, and my man loved it! I thought it smelled kind of piney, like a Christmas tree, but it's not a heavy fragrance which is good. In fact I loved it more throughout the wear.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"Love it, love it, love it!!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I first smelled this perfume on a paper strip while walking through Macy's in Manhattan in 1999. It was Christmas, and they had perfume girls spritzing all the new fragrances. Well as I walked by, the perfume girl handed me a strip and said, ""Berries and chocolate."" I continued walking and didn't think much of it. Even after smelling it on the strip, I was a bit overwhelmed because it's a very heady strong scent. At that point the strongest perfume I had ever worn was Calvin's Obsession. I put the strip into my purse and promptly forgot about it. That is, until an hour later, when I smelled it as it was settling. I fell in love. Since I was still in Macy's I promptly went back to the perfume counter and had her spray my wrist. I didn't buy it that day, but a year later, my husband bought it for me, and I have worn it every winter since. It's now my signature scent and I have a mini panic attack when I realize I'm running low. As I said, I generally wear it during the winter, and I switch to a lighter fragrance for summer. But if it's a special night out during the warmer months, on goes my Angel. It makes me feel like a sophisticated grown up! ;-)",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I tried this on a paper scent strip and thought it was much too masculine so walked over to some other orientals. I ended up ordering atelier's vanille absolue and Angel was just one of my samples. When I tried this actually on my skin, I fell in love. My mother always wore opium and this to me, smells like a sweeter modern incense-like smell for our generation. The spicy incense dries down to the most delicious vanilla/chocolate scent. I am now wishing I had purchased this in the first place!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"This is definitely a scent you love or hate. It has a really heavy sillage that seems to stay put for the whole day. So use a light hand with this. It's quite spicy at first, very musky for the whole wear, and as it settles in to your skin, you really start noticing the complexity. I love Thierry Mugler perfumes so very much. Bold and unique fragrances each time. Though if you find Angel to be too strong or musky, the EDT may appeal to you. The red berries become one of the more prominent of the notes in the EDT version and the candied praline in place of the chocolate and caramel of this original makes for a sweeter, fruitier perfume. Experiment and enjoy!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,I received this fragrance as a sample from Sephora and thought I had mistakenly been sent a mens cologne. The smell is very masculine and not something I would wear.,1,Sephora,us
Angel,"I love this scent. It is very Addicting. Wish is stayed stronger, longer, but it's so good that I'm ok with reapplying if I need to!",4,Sephora,us
Angel,I came across the scent by accident and then had to have it. It is a deep rounded floral musk....that's the best I can describe. But it only takes a bit and lasts. It's original and I truly love it.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"Either love it or hate it..

It is super noticeable and not light at all very christmas-y!!",3,Sephora,us
Angel,I have worn this fragrance for 14 years. I get compliments everywhere I go about this scent.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,I love love love love love this fragrance! I love all of Thierry Mugler's fragrances but this one is my favorite. And the bottle is re-fillable...how can you go wrong?,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I'm using Angel for over 10 years. Angel is fabulous and I will never change to another perfume. Tip: If you want to surprise with a new fragrance or want someone to remind you, this is the perfect perfume.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,I have been a Theirry Muggler girl for 13 years. Angel is all I wear and all I will ever wear.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,My all time favorite fragrance!!,5,Sephora,us
Angel,I personally cannot stand this perfume but my mother is crazy about it. She requested a huge bottle for christmas!,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I am in love wirh Angel. It is sweet but not to sweet and floral but just a hint and the dry down is so seductive.
Like other comments you either love or hate Angel. Just don't knock it til you try it.
I have worn a lot of scents trying to find my signature scent, and I finally found it. The smell is addicting and I am hooked!!!!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I love, love, love this scent. It was overwhelming the first few times I wore it (got a sample with an online purchase) but it grew on me. Someone else labeled it as intoxicating and it definitely is. I can't get enough of it now!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,I love this scent. Everytime I wear I continuously smell the spot I sprayed it. It's like smokey dessert. It's sweet and chocolatey but not overly so. In love!,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"This smells different on everyone. For some it's a hit (like me) and for others it's a fail. My dude loves this on me, and I get so many complements. Hope that it is never discontinued.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,I love this fragrance. It lasts a long time and has a scent that's so distinct!,5,Sephora,us
Angel,I'm a huge fan of Angel. I recently bought the perfume stick and love it! I can carry it right in my purse and carry one of my fav fragrances with me!,5,Sephora,us
Angel,I love the scent it's strong but soft at the very end it lasts all day Long love love love,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"My boyfriend got this for me from Sephora he didn't pick it out a sales rep help him. I heard a lot of rave from this so I was excited. When I first sprayed this on my arm is was very overpowering, warm, and strong for my liking. I tired wearing this at night time for a while to make it grow on me but I just couldn't. I am just a fresh/floral type of perfume lover. I do feel bad because I really wanted to like it. Now it just sits on my shelf maybe one day I will change my mind.",1,Sephora,us
Angel,"I always get the bottled refill for my star(s). The stores offer them but somehow the fragrance is never exactly the same from their ""source"". To guarantee I have the same fragrance I have loved for over 15 years, I buy the bottled one and recycle the bottle.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"This fits easily in the baggie allowed for carry-on fluids. Perfect dimensions, very little bulk. Yay!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,I bought this because someone was wearing it and I thought it smelled delicious! But on me it doesn't smell anything like I remember. Maybe its just not for me! It wasn't bad but it wasn't great :/,3,Sephora,us
Angel,I love the perfume I got in the small version of this. This one has a different scent. Doesn't last as long. But I do get a lot of compliments,3,Sephora,us
Angel,"I got this scent at the suggestion of a friend who really likes it. I wasn't sure at first if I really liked it, it has a stronger smell than I am used to wearing. It has been growing on me each time that I wear it and people seem to like it as well. I have been told it has a ""chocolatey"" smell which I don't really notice but I guess it is similar. It is pretty strong and long lasting; I don't really know how to describe it other than a deep, warm, scent. I like it more after it wears off a bit, I am not a huge fan of the initial smell of it on me. When I wear it, I put it on at least an hour or more before I leave so it is not as strong. I think I'd give this more of 3.5 rating rather than 4, not because it smells bad but because of my own personal taste.",4,Sephora,us
Angel,"I really wanted to like this perfume, but it's way too strong for my liking. While it does has an invigorating, unique scent; I found it too cologne-like (manly). There's a weird spicy smell to this perfume and I don't find it feminine or pretty.",2,Sephora,us
Angel,"this perfume is either a love or hate for most women. I love it at first, but I do not particularly like the dry-down scent after wearing it for a while. Just not my cup of tea...very ""powdery"" after it dries down",3,Sephora,us
Angel,"I was introduced to this by a very good friend of mine who has been wearing this for several years and the perfume has her and her husband addicted who by the way never ""lets"" her wear anything else. Angel is sweet, lusty, warm, sensual, intoxicating, irresistible, addictive, magical, heavenly, sexy, and just Angelic. I actually prefer wearing the Angel for Men which has a little more of a dark and lust finish on me. I just love it, I am nuzzling my nose against this as I type this. Very likely to become my signature fragrance!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"Ever since first smelling Angel on one of my old high school teachers, I've been addicted. It has a very warm, rich smell that works on almost everyone. My mom and sister wear it now after smelling it on me for years and it definitely has a slightly different smell on all of us (I bring out the hint of patchouli). This is my staple scent and due to the price, I keep trying to get cheaper versions (Calvin Klein Euphoria) but they're not the same. For one, every winter when I bring out my scarves and coats, I can STILL smell the Angel on them (crazy!?) This is literally the only perfume that I can put on at 5AM and still smell it on me the next morning when I get up. I LOVE LOVE Angel and it is one of those perfumes that just becomes your signature scent.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I purchased Angel after I had purchased Alien. I bought Alien because by reading the description it sounded amazing. While I thought Alien would be the scent for me, i went back a couple days later and smelled Angel. At first smell I was in love. I had to have it. So I purchased the set on here that came with the free clutch. No regrets and now I have both Alien and Angel. However, I haven't gotten any compliments on Angel but I have on Alien.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"The reason I like Thierry Mugler scents is because they have a distinctiveness to them that makes them stand out among others out there today. I recently purchased Angel after eyeing it for years. It is addictive. The scent itself is powerful and fresh while slightly masculine, which I like because it makes it all the more curious without taking away from its womanly allure. The eau de parfum version of the scent lasts incredibly long and is strong but not overpowering (a little bit goes a long way). I work in a restaurant and I like to wear perfume when I'm there so I don't feel totally disgusting and sweaty throughout the shift. With that being said, even several hours after spraying Angel on myself I was receiving compliments from customers and coworkers (even those working behind the line in the kitchen! Do you know how hard it is to smell anything but what you're cooking when you are behind the line in an industrial kitchen!?). Long story short Thierry Mugler Angel is the whole package as far as perfumes go. It is enigmatic, a great formula, has beautiful and functional packaging, can be worn any season, and is liked by others. I think I've found a new signature scent.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,Love this scent...still receive compliments after many years of use.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"Can I just say I love,love,love this prefume! Its so rare to come across a scent that can speak volumes on who you are- for me, its Angel. The dark & light meet harmonisly in this beautiful perfume",5,Sephora,us
Angel,This is the only parfum-people always ask me what i am wearing-tell me it smeels good-at first i thought it maybe to strong-but now i truly love it-the woman that works at wawa calls me angel when i go in there- because she remembers it on me-finally i have a signature fragrance-i do wear angel by victoria secrets-gucci guity -fendi-and a couple others-but this is the only one people always say something when i wear it-i feel it could be strong for some -i even got the body cream-it is expessive but well worth it for me- get a sample first,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"This was on sale pretty cheap on hautelook so I decided to give it a look on here, amazon and fragrantica. Well I was hooked of course by the reviews. Lasts 200 hours? Beastly sillage? Check! Fragrances dissolve on me like loves baby soft. And the notes sounded intriguing and to my liking. So I went to the mall and tried some generous spritzes immediately. My first impression was kinda ambivalent. Bunks the 'love it or hate it' theory. I kinda forgot about it. Then, it was the next day, and I smelled the residuals on my jacket. Well I ripped the fuzzy hood liner off that baby and snapped it to my neck so I could bask in the heavenly sluice all day. Dark yet sweet divine vanilla-y patchouli. It did not arrive in the mail soon enough... I was literally checking the tracking every hour so I could go home and get it immediately when it arrived. Oh.. And those sweet top notes? I'm now hooked on those, as well. Look out, skeptics, this scent will grow on you like a fungus. Yes, there is a faint dirty body odor thing going which is called patchouli. Remember, hippies wore it, and they smelled 'dirty'? That was patchouli. It's earthy and not for the faint hearted. Yet, it's sweet too! Confusion, on line one! This is a heavy, heady scent that is complex and should be worn with confidence. This is no shrinking violet. It's so me. My other favorite scent is shalimar if that says anything about my taste which I don't think does. Sorry, people around me who can smell this (and the sillage is nowhere near as scary ON ME than I was looking forward to), but this is my dark angel. The bottle should be a black boudoir job from the 20s. Try but don't write it off right away. It may have you coming back. On to the hair spritz and deodorant!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I've never been a perfume person, mainly because I hadn't found one that I truly liked. But I've fallen on love with angel!!! It doesn't take much just a spray, if you spray to much it can be REALLY over powerful. I feel very sexy when I'm wearing angel and I've gotten a lot of complements on the smell.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"Love this! It is very strong, but lasts forever. A sensual, warm scent, lots of Patchouli without being ""hippy"".",5,Sephora,us
Angel,Love this perfume. Wish they would come out with a nice body wash to match. Delicious scent,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"Spicy, light and I always receive compliments when I wear it. Love the blend of vanilla, sandalwood & patchouli.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"This perfume either smells wonderful on you or horrible. There is no in between. I love it and men stop me to smell me, very sexy. A coworker loved it on me and bought it only to find that it smelled like BO on her. It lasts forever and the lotion is amazing to use also. It isn't for the perfume shy because its very strong but I also wear Chanel no 5, which is strong. Try a sample to see if it works for you.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"VERY invasive. It's a beautiful scent, but once again, a little goes a long way! Lasts pretty long too!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,Decadent! Love love love this fragrance,5,Sephora,us
Angel,I've worn Angel for 7 or 8 years now. I am 100% obsessed. I love the patchouli in it - lovely!,5,Sephora,us
Angel,Angel has very distinct fragrance: that's why I love it so much! Most other perfume I sampled all has similarity feel. This one may be a bit sweeter but it is sexy and dreamy. It is one of my dating must-haves. I also like to spray it in the room while I'm working late.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"Thierry Mugler's Angel is a very distinct stylized scent, it is not for every woman but I personally am in love with it. It is a more musky warm sensual scent which is great for the cold seasons or for when your in the mood for something sexy. Definitely one to test out before you buy to see if this unique perfume is for you - at your local Sephora shop they will always give you a sample upon request!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,My favorite scent. Can't go wrong.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"i got the mini size of this perfume, and although i was a bit disappointed with its size, the fantastic smell over rides this factor. Great buy!",4,Sephora,us
Angel,"Never before have I had such a negative reaction to a perfume. Usually I either love a perfume, or have a bit of a ""meh"" attitude towards it. This perfume, however, was absolutely hideous. I have been known for my good ""nose"" when it comes to wines--for being able to breakdown scents in a wine. I'm not sure if or how this translates to perfumes, but when I put this on, I immediately smelled three distinct scents: baby powder, cleaning fluid (along the lines of a pinesol type) and cat urine. Needless to say, NOT a good mix! It was so awful that I tried to scrub it off. After scrubbing, it had just more of a faint body odor type scent. All in all...just really nasty. Thankfully I'd gotten only a tester, not a full bottle!! Yuck.",1,Sephora,us
Angel,"Been wearing this scent for years, always purchase this largest refill bottle to refill my spray bottle instead of taking it to the store for refilling.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I really adore the Angel eau de toilette, so I decided to test the Angel eau de perfum. Despite having similar notes, the two smell very different from each other. This review will be for the eau de parfum.

Angel EDP is very unique and started the trend of gourmand fragrances. I heard that this is extremely strong and heavy, so I put one timid spray directly on my wrist. It opens with a delicious smell of chocolate and cocoa and some fruits lingering in the background. It’s quite a strange combination and contrast, but it surprisingly works. As unique as the chocolate note is, I’m not a fan of smelling exactly like chocolate, so I was thankful that the chocolate smell seemed to fade into the other sweet notes like the berries and honey.

After the first half hour, I don’t really smell any one note in particular. The red berries, dewberries, apricots, honey, roses, jasmine, and all the other top and middle notes seem to blend together into one sweet and comforting concoction. But it's not light and airy; it's quite earthy and heavy from the patchouli. After 90 minutes, patchouli and vanilla are the two main notes and remain the star players in this fragrance. If you dislike patchouli, stay away. I don’t detect the chocolate or caramel that I smelled earlier because it’s completely blended.

As for sillage and longevity, one little spray on my wrist was a good amount; I probably should have added another spritz but I was scared to. After all, I put 3-4 spritzes of the EDT on me before, and the smell of patchouli hovered around me like a cloud. With the EDP, the first 90 minutes were very strong, but it faded from my skin quickly after that, so I shouldn’t have been so timid when applying it. Three hours into wearing Angel, I had to put my wrist directly to my boyfriend’s nose before he could really smell anything, and he thought it was just “okay.” This is best for fall/winter. I imagine the patchouli and chocolate in summer would feel too heavy. I wouldn’t wear this daily; I would save the heavy patchouli scent for certain days.

Angel was created with the intention of evoking childhood memories, and while the EDP did not remind me of my childhood, the EDT definitely succeeds in doing so. Between the EDP and EDT, I prefer the EDT. It smells slightly fruitier and softer from the berries, while the EDP smells heavier from the chocolate, vanilla, and caramel mixing with patchouli and amber. But I do really, really like Angel EDP though, which was fortunate since Angel truly is a controversial “love it or hate it” fragrance.

Overall, I don’t find it overbearing when applied lightly. There’s strong chocolate in the opening and strong patchouli and some vanilla at the end. I don’t consider this sexy, but it is comforting and warm. I like the shooting star bottle, but not the rising star bottle because the nozzle feels flimsy (and I've seen the top presser broken on testers in many stores). I like that you can buy the refillable bottle, too. This unique perfume is one that truly does smell different depending on the person’s chemistry, so I discourage against a blind purchase.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"After getting a perfume sample of this with my last online order, I fell in love! I knew I was destined to have this smell on my body, lol! I asked for a bottle for Christmas. Within 15 minutes of putting it on, it adjusts to this fabulous unique, comforting smell. I've many gotten compliments when I wear it. Also, I have the Eau de Toilette and I find that the smell still lasts quite long!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I tried this at the store and it smelled terrible! My grandma wouldn't even wear something like this. It was way too strong and did last a VERY long time, but that made it even worse because I just wanted to get the smell off of me. Definitely try it on before you buy it.",1,Sephora,us
Angel,"I like this perfume, it's not my love that's Alien. I really like to wear this in the winter it has a great musk like scent. While staying very unique in an office of 400+ people I'm the only one who wears it that I'm aware of and I see over half of them. One of my big turn offs on this on is that when I first put it on to me I am reminded of horrid body odor. The kind where you wanna buy them a bath kit. After 30 minutes to 1 hour it turns into an amazing scent that I get multiple compliments on considering I spend 10 hours a day leaning over people in cubicles. Plus the refill bottles save you in the end. Just never spray it on your clothing, it's meant to work with your body chemistry and on your clothes it just reeks. Trust me it's strong enough just on skin!",4,Sephora,us
Angel,"I wore this fragrance years ago and forgot how incredible it smells. I get so many compliments when I wear it. A little goes a long way, so this size is perfect if you're new to the fragrance or just want to spice up your perfume collection! Ladies, men love the scent of Angel! So be prepared for many compliments and seductive nights with your man ;)",4,Sephora,us
Angel,"I've had a love-hate relationship ever since I first smelled Angel a couple of years ago. The scent can be potent and overbearing when its first spritzed. You do have to wait a couple of hours to let it settle and air out a bit. If I could choose one word to describe it, it would be unique. I can find many substitutes for my Gucci Guilty, Viva la Juicy, Dolce Gabana The One (original, not Blue), Paco Rabanne Lady Million, and my Burberry Brit. I, however, can't find anything that would smell like this fragrance.

Warning: it is a perfume that not everyone will like. While I do get compliments, I also got some eyebrow raising from two of my close friends that are also obsessed w/ perfume as much as I am. I've never had them question my scent preferences haha

Alongside it being a unique scent, another big pro is that its long lasting. I don't ever have to spritz it on again during the day.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,I love this fragrance ...it's Heavenly!,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I absolutely adore this fragrance. I am SO picky when it comes to them. It is the perfect mix of feminine, musky, and exotic. I can't count the number of times I have asked someone what scent they were wearing only to hear ""angel"". I finally purchased it myself and am so happy I did.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I admit that when I first smelled this, I thought that it did not smell very good; however, after about 15 minutes, I could not get enough of this smell. I have a friend who wears this and it smells different on her. It is a great perfume that adjusts to your body chemistry and will garner many compliments. You just have to get over the initial reaction. Trust me, you will get many compliments.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,You spray it on and there is no fragrance 30 minutes later. I am very disappointed.When I apply other fragrances i can still smell them at bedtime... Big sephora fan...now i will have to be careful with new fragrances...,1,Sephora,us
Angel,I heard so much about this scent so I decided to try it. Big disappointment. It's overbearing. Way to much cinnamon or whatever spice is in there.,1,Sephora,us
Angel,"I've tried several perfumes and always feel like they fade away too quickly and I've wasted my money. I remember smelling this at a local department store and thought it smelled horrible. The fragrance rep said it smells completely different on everyone and it shod try it. I sprayed it on and still hated it a few minutes later. I had a dinner meeting with a co worker one night and smelled this really great perfume. When she said it was Angel, I was surprised. So, I remembered the rep telling me how unique it smells on everyone and thought it just must not work for me.

A couple of weeks ago I decided to ask for a sample of Angel just to give it another try and I'm so glad I did! As others have mentioned, it does kinda stink at first but fades out into a wonderful smell! I love it so much now that I bought the gift set. Definitely request a sample and give it a few days. You may still not like it, but you may decide you love it after all!

It is expensive but It seems to last longer than most and a lot of the bottles are refillable. :)",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I've known of this fragrance for years now but never had an interest in smelling it, let alone purchasing. Well I have over 50 name brand favorites and wanted to try something new this year. I chose Angel by Thierry Mugler without a prior whiff. At first contact I hated it. Within a few minutes I fell in love and could not stop smelling it. I've gotten compliments from people that generally wouldn't notice or acknowledge a nice scent. I love it and have recently purchased a second bottle because I know I'll always love it.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I personally dislike this scent. I find it's one of the worst perfumes I've ever smelt, however, I do know many people who do wear and love this scent and say they get so many compliments with it. The Patchouli in the fragrance is very bold and the scent is like no other! I love the fact that this is refillable though.",2,Sephora,us
Angel,"Honestly for the first hour I wear it I can't stand the way it smells. After that it turns into this amazing sent, but only when it's on my skin. If I spray it on my clothing it never turns into a nice smell, in fact it only works out on my skin. I'll never spray it on my clothes again, it started with a bad smell and stayed that way. But that doesn't matter since the strength is strong and only needs a small amount on skin to be noticed by others around you",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"Lovely perfume, great size. I normally purchase the full size product, but the .23oz is awesome for keeping in my handbag, or toiletries back when traveling.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I just love Angel and have been wearing it on and off forever, but this time I just purchased the little travel size perfume of Angel! It has lasted me so much longer than I anticipated! Such a perfect size to pop into my handbag, or cosmetics bag when I go away. I love it. Will definitely be buying this again!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"This fragrance is like nothing I've ever smelled! It is quite masculine for a woman's perfume, but I like musky scents so that's perfect for me. It has good lasting power (7+ hrs), and the bottle is nice. The only downsides are the price, and on some of my friends the smell goes a bit raunchy so try it before you buy it.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"Sorry, this fragrance evoked nothing but nightmares. Truly stinky stuff.",1,Sephora,us
Angel,I really like this perfume! Its deep and rich and makes me feel cozy every time i wear it. It goes on a bit strong then eases fast into a lovely rich smelling honey fragrance. Heavenly!,5,Sephora,us
Angel,I have been searching for a new scent for awhile. I fell in love with this. I have had people tell me I smell really good.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I have gotten more compliments on this spicy,unique fragrance. Just ordered Alien which I can't wait to try.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,I requested a rollerball but received a rollerball type dispenser but it was a spray. It leaks a bit around the top if you lay it down. I wanted it for travel but keep it at home because of this. Regardless I love the fragrance and so do many people!,4,Sephora,us
Angel,"There was a group of ladies in Macy's swooning over this scent so I asked for a sample. I decided to spray a little on my wrist and I thought, EWWWW, why did I do that?!? Hours later I kept smelling this delicate, sweet fragrance and wondered what it was. I smelled my wrist and fell in love. I wore the sample the next few days and while at a dinner reception, our waitress asked what I was wearing. I was surprised she smelled it because I could no longer smell it. I decided to purchase and get so many compliments. IN LOVE!!!!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I absolutely LOVE this fragrance not only because it has such a wonderful scent, but because it gets me noticed. People always comment on what I'm wearing when they're next to me or I walk into a room. Other scents like Flowerbomb and Coco Madamemoiselle, as wonderful as they are, just don't mesh well with me and are overall, a waste of my money. This product will last me a full 14 hours. It's quite pricey, but it's a great investment if you're someone looking to make a statement! It's definitely a strong fragrance, be warned if you're more into subtle scents. Love, love, love this perfume!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"Besides one Chanel, perfumes don't stay on me at all. But this Angel stays on me all day long! It has all the right combination of ingredients. I get many compliments and this is my new signature perfume. When I walk into a room people know is me coming. Buy it & you'll fall in love.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"Angel .23 spray , great sent.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"This is my new fave right now. It does come off a little strongly at first (sandalwood) but then it turns into this softer sweeter scent.

I keep it in my purse!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,I've never seen this shape and size before! Perfect for on the go!! I ALWAYS get compliments when I wear Angel!!,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"Not going to lie, I hated this perfume the first time I tried it. I received a sample in my latest order and was so excited to smell what all the hype over this fragrance has been about. First impression: YUCK! I was not impressed in the least bit. It reminded me of soured fruit.. or something equally as unappealing. For whatever reason a couple days later I came back to the sample. I tried it again and still wasn't entirely impressed. Then, magically, throughout the day this fragrance morphed into something truly amazing. It has this wonderfully clean, sexy (yet innocent) smell to it. I am still not a total fan of the top notes, but the mid and base, oh my! Love, love, love! It lasts wonderfully and, simply put, is just absolutely amazing. I will be purchasing the full size in the next week or so.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"Okay, so here's the deal. When I wear this perfume, I smell like I haven't taken a shower in 4 months. When I spray it on my clothes, it smells really bad for a while and then smells good. It smells amazing on my sister, but not on me. I guess it just depends how it smells on different people... But when it doesn't smell like hobo, it smells soooo good! Weird, huh?",2,Sephora,us
Angel,"SO strong, and vile. Received a trial size and after s couple sprays threw it out.",1,Sephora,us
Angel,This is average in my opinion. Maybe it is just me but I smell spices in this and it makes my throat feel a little uncomfortable if I spray this sample twice on me at once.,3,Sephora,us
Angel,"This perfume is the best. I am a perfume junkie; I love trying new fragrances. This is the only one I keep coming back to; it is long-lasting and smells wonderful. Every time I wear it someone will stop me and ask what I am wearing. If you are looking for a fragrance that will last all day, try Angel.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"Angel is my all-time favorite, signature scent. It's strong enough to last, but isn't over-powering. I have no desire to have my perfume announce my arrival. This never does, but it is noticed. Being told ""you smell good"" by someone who matters, makes my day!!!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I love this purfume but it has to work with your body chemistry. It smells so good on me that people stop me everywhere to ask me what I am wearing but a coworker started to wear it after smelling it on me and it""s not the same. Try a sample first to see if it works for you. SUPER sexy if it does!!!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I have been an Angel wearer on and off for the past 6 years. I stopped wearing it for 2 years and just started wearing it again. My husband finds me irresistible with it on. I just received the body lotion sample with my full sized bottle. The lotion is to dye for, I'm looking at buying it right now.

The perfume only spray one time 4 inches away from wrist or neck and allow for 15 minutes for it to sink into your body. The smell at first is extremely intense, but after 15 minutes it mutes down to a pleasant smell. Do not spray this on your clothing, it will be too intense.
This fragrance melts into your body, and works with your chemistry. Some people this fragrance doesn't match their own body scent. I would recommend this fragrance to anyone. It is really a sexy smell, and it is very sophisticated.

The body cream seems to be less intense and more softer notes. I will be buying a bottle soon.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"Ladies, Negative comments?? I can't figure out why your noses are sending you these bad signals!! Try again!
Each and every time I wear my Angel to work, every man in the place tells me that I smell amazing. I have never had such consistent compliments with any other fragrance. My husband and sons love the way it smells on me too, so it's never hard to find a little ""gift supply"" of it during the holiday season. Even though I will wear other fragrances at times, Angel is the only one I can NEVER be without. PS: If you ever happen to splurge on the pure parfum, you will be hooked for life!!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I was surprised to read so many horrible reviews, so wanted to add my 2 cents in. This is a very popular, high end fragrance and is a best seller at the most elite stores. I find it beautiful,sexy,classy and it lasts very long!!! It is a scent not like any other, maybe that's why the poor reviews? I wouldn't call it fruity or floral like, I can't describe it. My favorite scents are Jadore, The One, Poison, Rock n Rose,Acqua di GIO, Daisy, D&G #3, Burberry Brit, the many fruity Escada scents and more. I like strong scents and feel my perfume taste is good[I hope:)] When I wear this, I feel happy and love to smell myself. I am the one who sprays too much on because I want to smell it on myself and usually can't after about 10 mins with other fragrances, but this I smell. It reminds me of a day of shopping and being in the beauty dept of my favorite stores.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"When I first tried this fragrance, I thought it smelled way too strong and ""yuck"" and that I definitely wouldn't be using it again (I got a sample with my order). However, I tried it again and have actually grown to love it! A little goes a long way so you don't need much. I also find the lasting power to be very good. This reminds me of a cozy winter scent- definitely one for cooler months. I have ordered another sample but am thinking about repurchasing once they're gone!",4,Sephora,us
Angel,worst perfume ever!! dont ever waste your money!!!!!,1,Sephora,us
Angel,"Surprised so many people hate it. Also got it as a sample in my recent order. I really like it so far. Very sweet floral scent, and feels very warm in this cold weather. Couldn't help smelling my wrist a few times this morning...anyway, not sure the lasting power, but so far I like this scent",4,Sephora,us
Angel,"My reaction upon smelling this for the first time was ""YUCK"". However, convinced by my perfume board to give it another try (with the key advice that it was to be worn only in very, very small doses), I ordered a sample with my F&F purchase. My second wearing was ambivalent--the bergamot was overwhelming, but the drydown was lovely, sweet and warm.

My third wearing, I couldn't stop sniffing my wrist. The bergamot was no longer offensive to my nose, and I thoroughly enjoyed how much it transformed on my skin throughout the day.",4,Sephora,us
Angel,I was so excited to smell this sample. This stuff smells awful! It reminds me of garbage...yuck!,1,Sephora,us
Angel,Got this as a sample and the minute I sprayed it on I could not believe how horrible it smelled ~ PeeYew! I immediately tried washing it off and even took another fragrance to spray over it and could still smell the rancid funky odor. The most offensive perfume I've ever encountered!!!,1,Sephora,us
Angel,"This scent is definitely not like any other. I like that it is refillable. However, it is not my favorite fragrance. It is unique and I don't always feel like smelling like chocolate. I tend to use one spay of this and spray Womanity on top of it. I think the mixture of both together smells great.",3,Sephora,us
Angel,"I spent 100pts to get a delux sample because it look so cute, but I through it away right after I received this product, it smelled awful",1,Sephora,us
Angel,"I got this as a sample, and wow!!! It reeks!! It smells powdery and a strong woodsy scent. It smells like baby johnson powder. I wish I was exaggerating about this. If you want to smell like a baby's butt then go right ahead and purchase the full size of this.",1,Sephora,us
Angel,Received a sample and tried a spritz. Cloying and heavy. Definitely NOT the scent I want someone to register with my entry into a room. UGH! So glad I tried it b/f buying a full size.,1,Sephora,us
Angel,This is a beautiful winter scent both earthy and sweet... the stronger notes are the honey and patchouli...with the lighter notes of Vanilla and bergamot ....its warm smelling and dreamy...,4,Sephora,us
Angel,its smells like all the hippy kids in high school that didn't shower. I don't smell any notes besides patchouli and stinky. Its stinks and its nauseating.,1,Sephora,us
Angel,"I received a sample today in the mail. I disliked the smell in the initial seconds after spraying. It reminded me of my grandmother; though I love her dearly, I really do not want to smell matronly. However, after a few minutes the smell toned down into a soft, sensual scent. For me, this would be something to wear on special occasions rather than daily. Overall, it's a sweet, elegant, mature perfume.",4,Sephora,us
Angel,"I love ""Womanity"" so I thought I would try out ""Angel"". If patchouli is your thing then go for this perfume! I smell no other notes except for patchouli. Like all Thierry Mugler perfumes, one little drop is all you need. I honestly sprayed one small squirt on my wrist and I felt like I had an aura of patchouli around me. I smelled like a patchouli candle and had to wash it off after just 15 minutes. It might be better if it wasn't so strong.",2,Sephora,us
Angel,Great scent! Get stopped and asked what it is I am wearing a lot!,4,Sephora,us
Angel,"On me, I got chocolate and patch. A tiny tiny spritz goes a long way. I wore this when this first came out in the late 90's and will still wear this forever... Im glad this came out in a purse spray for travel, that big star bottle is bulky and dangerous ;). This is great for the fall/winter months.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"i have to say, when i smell anyone wearing this scent, it makes me nauseaous. it is the worst scent i have ever smelled. everytime i caught a whiff of someone wearing it, it has made me ill. i finally found out what that horrible scent was and this is it. horrible. everyone wearing this, please stop.",1,Sephora,us
Angel,This scent is soft and feminine. I feel like an angel when I wear it!,4,Sephora,us
Angel,I've used this perfume for a number of years and it never fails to deliver a long lasting and memorable fragrance. I receive compliments all the time and it has become my truly favorite one to wear!,5,Sephora,us
Angel,I AM A PARFUM A SKIN CARE ADDICT-I HAVE PURSCHASED LOT OF DIFFERENT PARFUMS-BUT HAVE NEVER GOTTEN SO MANY COMPLEINMENTS AS WHEN I WEAR THIS-I JUST STARED USING IT-AND TRULY LOVE IT-IT LAST ALONG TIME-NOT LIKE THE OTHER PARFUMS THAT WEAR OFF-IT IS IN A CLASS BY ITSELF-IT IS COSTLY-I PURSCHASED REFILL BOTTLE FOR $98.00-AS I DON'T LIKE THE STAR TO LAY FLAT ON MY DRESSER-SO I AM USING REFILL-AND WHEN I DO PURSCHASE IT NEXT TIME WILL GO FOR THE LARGE BOTTLE-,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"Angel is a pure classic. I get so much compliments while wearing it. Angel is angelic, comforting, and beautiful in every way. It's quite a shocker on the first spray, but after a while, it becomes such a deep, warm, vanilla, creamy scent. It reminds me of when I was younger, baking cookies with my mom and visiting family on Christmas day. I will forever cherish and love this fragrance. This scent should make everyone feel very beautiful and take them back to some point in the life. Unless you completely hate the scent and cannot even stand one drop of it, then forget it. But I for one, am in love with this perfume. Angel is heavenly. LOVE that it can be refilled!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"This is by FAR my favorite scent. Not all scents work the same with everyone's chemistry, but this perfume is memorable, beautiful, intriguing and even tantallyzing when used judicially.

The vanilla, chocolate and mix of light spices have always had men and women alike and often young men asking me what the beautiful scent is. But I will warn, if you can smell it after you have placed a touch behind the ears, one on the throat and on the wrists--and I mean a touch--you have put on too much.
This perfume 'Less is More.'",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I receive compliments everyday! People are always asking me ""what am I wearing?"" Such a wonderful scent - it's my signature scent! Love it!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I have wants this perfume for a whole now, I'm happy I finally purchased it. I love the smell as do my husband, I always get compliments. Love it!",4,Sephora,us
Angel,"I remember when I first smelt this fragrance. It was many years ago, and it caught my attention right away.

This parfum have a vast ingredient list, however I've always smelt the lighter scents way above the deeper. (ie: bergamot vs. chocolate, red berries vs. vanilla... you get the idea).

All in all, this is a nice smelling parfum, very feminine, clean, with a hint of sexiness to it. And on a different note, the bottle is delicate and pretty, if you care for those things.",4,Sephora,us
Angel,"This perfume is so clean smelling but still feminine, my daughter loves it and also Womanity. It is not a heavy perfume and leaves just enough scent for all day.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I loved this scent since I came across a a sample in a magazine. It's somewhat musky. One of my new favorites, however a little goes a long way! It's a little on the strong side.",4,Sephora,us
Angel,"Having never purchased this perfume before, I bought this size to try it and take while traveling. Not only did I love it, I returned and bought the larger refill bottle!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,Favorite fragrance of all time.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"This perfume smells nice, but man is it strong! I have the lotion, and I literally put a dot on my hand in the morning and it is powerful until the day's end. One squirt of the perfume and it's almost crossing the line of being too overpowering. I am someone who likes a perfume that has staying power and that you can actually smell-however this is almos crossing the line of being too strong. It does smell nice though, it can be a bit mature though. Definately try before you buy!",4,Sephora,us
Angel,"I had received a sample of Thierry Mugler's Angel EDP and I tried it out to see how it would wear on me. I LOVE it!!! It reminded me of a scent that I used wear ALL OF THE TIME: Sud Pacific - Abricot Vanille. On me it is a mix of that scent and Kate Walsh's Boyfriend (which I also l love and own). Again, scent is subjective and based solely on body chemistry, but on me I can really smell the honey, caramel, chocolate and some hint of berry.

One word: DELICIOUS!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,Everyone compliments me on this fragrance! Everyone.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"i really wanted to love this because the bottle is so beautiful. I don't know if it's the Bergamot, Dewberry, or what, but it smells skunkey to me. I even had to wash my nightgown and robe the next day, because it lingered on them, and me. The upside, if you like it, is it's long lasting.",1,Sephora,us
Angel,"I should've bought the bottle instead of the travel one. The spray on the travel size doesnt mist right, but it smells fantastic!!!",4,Sephora,us
Angel,I've been wearing the lotion in lieu of the perfume for several years now. I think it lasts longer and has a warmer smell. Two squirts that I rub into my arms lasts the entire day. Never fails to gain compliments as people ask what I'm wearing and comment on how much they love the scent.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"Just LOVE this! The perfect perfume for summer! The compact size is great for your purse or travel case. Also, a wonderful opportunity to wear this without spending a lot! Try it. It really is HEAVENLY!!!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"This is one of the most complex scents out there. I've worn Chanel for years and love how it melds to each individual -- no one girl smelling alike. Angel is like that, it compliments my individual self scent (if that can be understood) I always get compliments when I where this. It's also my husbands fav!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I absolute adore Angel! I've been wearing it since I was 17! It isn't for everyone, though. When asked what I'm wearing, which is quite often, I stress the need to try it on first.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I just love this fragrance. I was looking for a new scent for my 24, stuck on Burberry Brit, daughter and the woman at the fragrance counter recommended Angel and I bought it for her. She adores it and I loved it so much I went right out and bought a bottle for me. We never cease to receive positive comments when we wear it.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"Got this in the sampler set and was really surprised at how good it smells...especially since I have read some pretty negative reviews about this scent.

At first, it smells like musky old stench. I almost put the bottle away without trying it. However, if you do try it on, it transforms into this seductive mature scent that seems to change during the course of the hours.

The bottle is also unbelievably gorgeous.

I took away the star simply because I don't think this is the scent I'd wear on everyday basis and I'd get fired on the spot if I wore it to work (it's quite strong). But overall, long lasting power, unique scent...great perfume!",4,Sephora,us
Angel,"This long-lasting fragrance isn't going to be for everyone, of course, but if you like earthy, vanilla scents, you'll probably love this one. It smells different on every person, too: My mother-in-law and sister-in-law both wear Angel, and both smell totally different. It's nearly floral on my mother-in-law. I would call it almost spicy on me.

I always get compliments when I wear it--usually strange men ask me what I'm wearing--it's almost embarrassing. ;) But I'm nearly 40 and have four children, so I figure having a sexy scent is the least of my worries.

Long lasting, and refillable, too, what more can you ask? If you like a lighter version, try the Angel Eau de Toilette or Angel Innocent. Yes, it is expensive, but in my opinion, you get what you pay for--and some things (me, maybe?) are just worth it! ;)",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"The 0.5 fl oz is a good size for a gift, but I returned for a bigger size for myself because it's a much better deal per oz. The stars are nice because they are refillable, I won't comment on the fragrance except to say I find it lovely, but get a sample first (obv) because the notes can play out very differently on different skin types. I always get an EDP when possible, and the sillage on Angel is pretty good. Hate he name because it reminds me of VS Angel (gross!), but this is a wonderful perfume that I wear year round.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,Ii am absolutely in love with this fragrance! I really have one negative thing to say and that's that it's too expensive :/ I buy so much from sephora that I usually can find a promo code for a sample other wise I spend 25$ on the travel size which works for me. This scent is super sexy!! I live in the south and need a perfume that will last through the day during the hot and humid summer and this stands up! I highly recommend it.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"This isn't my first purchase of this brand. I've bought the cologne, the mini spray and now the lotion. I love the lotion because a little bit goes a long way. This is MY fragrance! It's sexy and seductive and the scent is heady-very intoxicating.

The lotion is a generous size and it's silky to the touch. It's something I do just for me - but my husband loves it as well!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"this has to be one of the most polarizing fragrances that I've ever heard of, and of course that meant I had to try it ;)
admittedly the list of notes longer than the Canon scared me, but they all seems to blend together into a wonderfully long lasting sweet, warm, and earthy scent that wraps me up in a soft heavenly haze. I think that me search for a signature fragrance is over :)",5,Sephora,us
Angel,I have been wearing Angel since it first came out. The the smell of this perfume and the fact that it only takes a squirt or two and the scent lasts forever.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I'm a perfume addict and I'm constantly looking for new scents. My perfume addiction started in my early teens and I remember I enjoyed the smell on Angel Innocent which is very similar to the original but thought it smelled too grown up for a teen. Another reason that kept me away from Angel is that it is very very strong and sometimes you come across a woman wearing way too much Angel and it is important to me not to offend people with my perfume. I recently received a sample(spray vial) and sprayed one little spritz. Loved it and husband loved it too(usually says most perfumes are boring or old lady) . I'm afraid that if I buy the full size spray bottle, one spray is too much. I love that this comes in a rollerball now and I can apply just a couple of small dabs on pulsepoints and not over do it! Definately for evening wear only.",4,Sephora,us
Angel,I have been wearing this perfume for 12 years and it is my all time favorite. It stays with you all day and any other Angel lovers will notice you right away. Hints of chocolate and berries made me fall in love.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I've reviewed this before, but I've now been wearing it for about a year and I still adore it. It's so unique - sweet, spicy and earthy at the same time. I've never smelled anything like it, and most other perfumes I try just bore me in comparison. Also, I get SO many compliments on how I smell. Almost any time I hug someone, they say something along the lines of, ""You smell AMAZING."" I was in a hotel on a business trip and ran into the maid who changed my sheets, and she even asked me what I wore because my pillowcases smelled so good. I get compliments from young people, older people, in-laws, family, friends, and strangers. So this perfume is doing something right :)",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"Angel deserves a second chance.
This fragrance is so unusual and really shocking at first. In no way is this perfume as stated (pure, soft, innocent). Angel is not for the faint of heart, and at first spray, it can seem overwhelming and dirty. Never really an alcoholic smell, but still very strong, without warmth or balance. BUT patience is virtue. Before you say no, try to wait half an hour. This is when the scent blooms and transforms.
Everybodys body chemistry is different, but I have been blessed. On my skin, Angel smells spicy and warm, very sensual. I can detect the chocolate, honey, berries and spice. My husband holds on to me and nuzzles in to get more, he loves it so much! He says this perfume is so sexy and very arousing. Naturally, that makes me love it even more! 6 star rating, really.
NOTE: This perfume is mature and probably best suited for women over 25.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,It's the best to carry with you where you go! And the scent is the best around....,5,Sephora,us
Angel,great perfume - love the bottle shape; strong fragrance,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I can't put my finger on what I love about this perfume. I'm usually a very fruity, citrus-y scent person, but I fell in love instantly with this. There's something in it that reminds me of childhood, and yet it's a very mysterious scent.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,men love this smell. I have been wearing this perfume for over 10years and consistely get comments about it. All day scent and that chocolate erotic smell wears through to the end.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"The first time I wore this fragrance, I was told that this fragrance smells very exotic on me. That sold it for me, I adore this scent, & love the fact that the stars are refillable(money saver)!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I am in love with this perfume. The bottle is stunning. The lasting power is incredible. This is such a complex fragrance that many women can't handle. I think it smells strong and sexy, I love the combination of all the fragrance notes. I will purchase forever.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,u know the smell of old homeless man who hasn't taken a shower for long... this is what it smells like. smells like armpit and body order like rotten meat smell. OMG. I regretted when I sprayed on my arms i felt like throwing up.,1,Sephora,us
Angel,"Got this as a sample with purchase and it is just not my style! I prefer scents that are light, fresh, fruity. This was very strong and perfume-y. It smelled like my grandma...",1,Sephora,us
Angel,"Pretty, but nothing special. Wouldn't buy.",4,Sephora,us
Angel,"I've seen so many positive reviews, but I absolutely hated this perfume! It had a strong, almost skunky smell that I couldn't stand! Definitely not for me.",1,Sephora,us
Angel,"I am obsessed with this fragrance! When I wear this, I feel so sexy and seductive. The notes of patchouli make it very warm and earthy. The vanilla in it is so soft and sweet. When I smell it, I imagine sugared almonds, deep blue silk, and a walk through the woods at dusk.
And the travel size fits so perfectly in my purse.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,One of the most amazing scents I have. I loved it the first time I tried it.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,this perfume is very sexy and exotic! you only need a few drops of this perfume or it can be a bit ovewhelming i do find that the body lotion works alot better with your body chemistry. its alot lighter but last all day. i get tons of compliments when i wear this perfume.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I got this as a sample, and I did not care for it at all. I thought it smelled like mosquito repellant and wd-40. My boyfriend smelled it on me and his eye started watering and twitching. Literally. Not for me.",1,Sephora,us
Angel,"I know the description says it evokes “childhood memories” and I can promise you that it doesn’t. Ladies, this is not the perfume for that!

It has a far more seductive/sexy scent that’s strong and almost a little musky, but pleasant. I really like it but you have to use VERY LITTLE because it can be overwhelming. It’s a very nuanced, intriguing scent. It’s definitely not something I’d make a “regular” perfume, but I’d wear it on occasion, when I’m in the right mood.",4,Sephora,us
Angel,"I think I would love this, without the chocolate note, to me it's a very jarring smell that jolts me too much to enjoy this scent.",1,Sephora,us
Angel,"This is a very strong fragrance- but strong isn't necessarily a bad thing. It's very, very reminiscent of Oscar De La Renta, or even Guerlain Shalimar (at least to me). If you only use a little squirt, this fragrance can be truly lovely.

It's musky and chocolately and sexy, perfect for date night or just when you want to feel strong and confident. I would say this is more of a mature fragrance, but I definitely think younger girls (like myself!) can rock this scent. Mugler's ALIEN still stands as my favorite scent from his line, but Angel is a really nice perfume.",4,Sephora,us
Angel,"I really like this purfume. You need only a spritz or two, else it be overwhelming. It's a complex scent, with many layers, but I think they all work together splendidly. It's not too feminine, yet not to be mistook for a mens cologne. It's clean, yet musky and slightly floral. I just can't stop smelling myself ;)
There's no explaining it, really- try it out.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I worked at Sephora and this was one of our best-selling fragrances, so I grabbed a free sample in my last order to try it out. It definitely does not work for me. I end up feeling like I smell like I have B.O. (the patchouli maybe?). I even had a co-worker comment on how she didn't approve of my ""new"" scent. Won't be using this one again.",1,Sephora,us
Angel,Good thing I did not buy this i tryed it on in the store and it smelled like my GRANDMOTHER!!!!,1,Sephora,us
Angel,"Love this perfume! It smells so wonderful. Like chocolate, vanilla, caramel, and patchouli (which I happen to like). It smells sweet yet complex. It starts off strong but after it's been on for an hour or so it softens to a nice, warm, chocolatey scent. My husband compliments me on my smell every single time I put this on, not realizing it's the perfume, he just thinks I somehow smell amazing after I spray this. It's a little pricey, but a little goes a long way so I'm happy with it.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I absolutely love Angel and wear it almost daily. People notice it in a good way :), ask what I am wearing and where they can purchase it. Angel lasts all day and is a strong scent so you have to make sure not to over do it and that it goes with your body chemistry.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"This is my favorite perfume. It is classy and appropriate for any occasion so I get a lot of wear out of it. I don't think it's limited to any one age group. The only thing I don't like is the price. It's more expensive than Chanel for Christ's sake. What is it, made of liquid gold? One star is getting knocked off for that, but I will still repurchase.",4,Sephora,us
Angel,"I love angel everything and have since i discovered it in2008. I don't plan to ever wear anythiing else. It's too bad that another company came out with an :""angel"" scent that is vastly inferior to the original",5,Sephora,us
Angel,Hands down the best perfume ever... love it..,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"My Daddy is a true gentleman:jewelry,perfume, etc. for the ladies in his life. So longer ago than I care to admit my parents were visiting the UK & my Da asked for help choosing a perfume for me (from a gorgeous dark tall perfume saleswoman he told me about many times lol) He described my style & she instantly recommended Angel. You couldn't even get it in the US @ that time.I felt so chic when I got it as my souvenir. Of course I LOVE it(!) and still wear it to this day. It's the only perfume that (repeatedly) men can recognize and name! I don't want to get stuck in a rut and smell the same for 75 yrs. but I love Angel & never stop getting complemented on it; so for for now it will continue to be my signature scent.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,This fragrance reminds me of the neon colored hairspray I used as a kid on Halloween. The poster who compared it to bug spray was also spot- on. Not one of Mugler's best.,1,Sephora,us
Angel,"I have been wearing Angel since May 1998. I remember the date so well. My sister and I tried this fragrance together. We fell in love with Angel and introduced it to my Mother and 2 other sisters. We have all been wearing Angel exclusively since. I continue to receive so many beautiful compliments when wearing this fragrance. Angel is the one and only frangrance I wear. So many stories I could tell you about Angel. Men and women, friends and strangers stop me and say the same thing... Wow! I love this fragrance. Strangers have stopped me asking for the name and have taken out pen and paper to write it down, especially men so they can pass along this astonishing romantic, intoxicating fragrance to those with whom they love. Recently I was in a large department store and overheard a man behind me excuse himself from a conversation and follow me. When I reached the second floor of the womens department, he kindly stopped me and ask me for the name of the fragrance. He told me a lovely story of an actress he worked with several years ago who wore the same fragrance. He told me of how he could not get that scent out of his head and when I walked passed him, he told me of how he was taken back with that same intoxicating scent and was so sorry he followed me, but had to know the name. He pulled out his business card and I gave him the name and when I said Angel, he was suddenly taken back. Well, the rest of the story is long and wonderful. Thank you Thierry Mugler!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"My mom had originally purchased this for ehr after smelling it on her friend, however the scent did not smell right on her, her body chemistry made it smell harsh and almost putrid, (she normally wears Obsession, which smells fantastic on her) She let me try it and it smells wonderful on me, I constantly get compliments on it, so she gave it to me... Now she kept smelling it on me and thought she was crazy so she bought another bottle of the stuff, still smelled rancid on her, so I now have my refill lol and I can say this is truly one you should try in the store and wear all day before buying. Very long lasting...",5,Sephora,us
Angel,I love love love this fragrance!!!!,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I was really excited to get this perfume after smelling it on a co-worker. I sprayed it on my wrist expecting an instant 'YES! I've found my perfume!!', but it just smelled rancid like old lady perfume mixed with bug spray. It took about a half hour before it started to smell beautiful to me - but my boyfriend said I smelled like an old woman and it was way too overpowering.

This perfume is definitely one that you have to spray on a half hour before you leave the house, or else you'll feel sorry for everyone around you. I'm not sure if I'm willing to bear the rancid smell for that long...",3,Sephora,us
Angel,"Thierry Mugler never ceases to please with the parfum Angel, the only hitch was that the funnel supplied to refill the bottle allows the precious liquid to freely spill. Other that smelling heavenly, that is all there is to say.",3,Sephora,us
Angel,This is the absolute best fragrance I have ever owned. No matter where I go I get compliments and they ask what I am wearing. It is my only winter fragrance. It is long lasting. You can apply it in the morning and when I get up the next morning I can still smell it on my wrists. Wonderfully clean scent.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"Love this scent! It's warm, inviting and intriguing.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"Not for everyone, but that just makes it better when it works for you. Long lasting, unique scent. I always get compliments. The refill idea is green and economical. That;s what finally swayed me to splurge.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"Oh, how I wanted to love this fragrance, but it did not mix well with my chemistry. Upon first application, the scent was....sharp, almost; very pungent and intense. Upon dry-down, it was a lot more bearable. It was soft and musky then, and I kind of liked it once it had almost faded away, sadly that wasn't enough to make me love it. I gave it to a relative, on whom it smelled amazing, so...Definitely try this out in store before you take the plunge. Good luck!",1,Sephora,us
Angel,"I wanted to love this fragrance. It smells incredible on others, almost like a soft musk, yet with a slight spiced base note. One day during a Sephora trip I spritzed a little on. I instantly was regretful. It smells horrible on me, like freshly ground peppercorns and capers...ick! What's worst is the scent is very long lasting and survived a hand/wrist washing in the bathroom. Thierry Mugler scents are very much based on one's body chemistry. Most people do not like Womanity because of this, I personally love and consider it to be my signature scent. Sadly Angel did not meet my expectations the way Womantiy has.",1,Sephora,us
Angel,"I don't smell the vanilla, caramel or chocolate in this perfume. The patchouli totally overwhelms any other fragrance. And I hate patchouli. It certainly does have staying power so, if you like the scent, that's a good thing. For me, I had to take two showers and wash my clothes, bedding and the slipcover on my couch to get rid of the patchouli odor, so I wasn't happy.",1,Sephora,us
Angel,"This perfume just doesn't work for me. I wish this would smell good on me like everyone else talks about. -The opening smells like a powdery men's cologn
-Heart note lasts 3+ hours and still smells like powdery men's cologn.
-Basenote does smell like white chocolate, but the heart note doesn't go away! Basically I smell like a man all for 3 hours. My bf does not like it. It's sitting in my perfume closet and I don't know what to do with it. : /",2,Sephora,us
Angel,this is a classic! i loved this when it first came out and still love it. its my top 3,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I fell in love with this perfume before I even knew what it was! In college, a classmate wore this and I loved it. I remembered she wore ""Angel"" but never put the two together. I received it as a sample from Sephora and immediatly recognized it and was hooked!
I used to wear more fruity and lighter perfumes, but this is now my signature scent.
The other reviewers are correct, it is not for everyone. It is strong, but it lasts and smells delicious all day!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I love Angel. It's a beautiful fragrance, and incredibly long lasting. It's a combination of many beautiful notes, blended into a beautiful fragrance. I first discovered Angel this year in the Sephora Favorites Collector's Edition Fragrance Samplers for Her. It was the firs sample I tried. It was definitely the best.

I tried the Angel Eau de Parfum first because the blue coloring in the Eau de Parfum caught my eye, and because I liked the bottle, which is shaped like a star. I immediately loved this fragrance. What was surprising was that there was virtually no fadeout. When I went to bed that evening, I could still smell the fragrance, although it wasn't quite as intense as it had been when I first applied it. What totally shocked me was that I could still smell it slightly when I woke up the next morning. My first thought was that my husband was playing some sort of joke on me and had applied more during the night, since I make him smell all the samples, in order to get his opinion. He insisted he hadn't. If the fragrance was lasting overnight, it would be impressive, but I tried it again, to be sure. The next morning it was barely there, but it did last, albeit faintly. And it had smelled great all during the day. Obviously, I redeemed my voucher certificate for a bottle of Angel.

I love Angel. In addition to trading in my gift voucher, I also purchased the Angel Gift Set, and a Parfum Spray to Go for my purse and for travel. I love the fragrance and have gotten so many compliments on it. The Angel Gift Set consists of a full size star shaped spray bottle of Eau de Parfum Spray, along with a generous 3 1/2 ounce tube of Perfuming Body Lotion and one ounce of Perfuming Shower Gel.

I love the fragrance, and I love how long it lasts. I love the body lotion, too. Angel is an impressive fragrance. I've gotten a huge amount of compliments when I've used it. My husband finds it sexy and innocent, at the same time. If you're looking for a new fragrance, definitely give this one a try.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"On 3 separate occasions, complete strangers, all men, have stopped me and asked me what the perfume I'm wearing was, followed by, ""it smells really good."" Maybe I just have really great pheromones.... :)",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I did not care for this at all. I can't even describe the smell, unlike some people,lol. My boyfriend didn't like it either so I def. will not wear this. Not only that, it doesn't come off!! I sprayed some on my wrist and some got onto my sweater. After taking the sweater out of the wash, I can still smell it! Pew!",1,Sephora,us
Angel,"My mom has always loved this scent, but, has been unable to wear it around me because, until recently, it triggered migraines on first sniff, However, I recently smelled it on someone in passing at a department store, and, thankfully, had no reaction. So, to celebrate, I recently bought my mom a bottle for Chanukkah. She's Thrilled, as am I. Thanks, Sephora! Now, for the actual review: This is a very strong scent from wet to dry. I get a lot of of the vanilla and caramel, and, a very strong underpinning of Patchouli. This is a scent definitely not for those looking for delicate gourmand scents. This is a powerful blend that needs to be applied with a very light hand. A little goes a very long way.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,I sprayed this on myself at a department store and at first I didn't like it. I very quickly changed my mind and could not stop sniffing my wrist all day! Since then I've received it as a gift and it is my favourite perfume. I am often asked what I am wearing as it smells SO good. This is one scent I will definitely always wear.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,I don't buy new fragrances often as I struggle to find ones that appeal to me enough to pay for them. This year I bought the sampler pack and of the 10 fragrances in there this is the one I chose the full sized bottle of. It's sexy but playful and very long lasting.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"Evokes tender childhood memories... Indeed it did, of eating too much candy. It smells like chocolate candy filled with orange flavored nougat. And the base smells just like a cheap perfume I had as child. I felt childish wearing this perfume, and not in a good way. The scent is also very strong and lasted for two full days. So if you like it I'm sure the staying power is a plus. Not for me.",1,Sephora,us
Angel,"I buy this every year as a gift for my mom. It's her ""signature scent."" Even better to purchase with a VIB discount. This is a really memorable, unique scent - instantly recognizable.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,Has an addictive caramel flavor that definitely attracts attention. Long lasting.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I love this perfume... so complex, yet simple... one of the best perfumes I've ever encountered!!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"This perfume is fantastic! My favorite part about it is the fragrance evolves throughout the day. The longer you have it on, the better it starts to smell. It is very recognizable as well. Someone always stops me and asks, ""Are you wearing Angel?""",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"The bottle is adorable, but the perfume smelled like rubber. :/",2,Sephora,us
Angel,"I admit that when I first smelled this fragrance many years ago, I thought it was horrid. By chance I smelled it recently and fell in love! On me, it smells like vanilla, chocolate, sandalwood, musk, honey, and caramel with just a hint of patchouli. It is a powerful fragrance and lasts all day long. One spray will do ya, although on the weekends I def spray more. My husband loves it. Angel is the queen of the gourmands!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,This perfume is so different. It's not like an over powering floral scent. It's very unique and smells great. It can be a bit strong at first but it'll calm down. I get compliments every time I wear it!,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I received this as a sample gift. I normally go for floral scents but I'm finding myself wanting to be a little more adventurous with my perfumes! My fav is Amazing Grace. At first, I was really put off by the way it smelled at the store but decided to try the free sample I got and was blown away by how different this scent was. First of all, I think Thierry Mugler scents are not for everyone and ensuring it goes well with your body chemistry before buying is a must. It surprisingly smells delicious on my skin. The chocolate scent stands out the most. Its comfortable and very cool, in a classy and very sexy way. I would wear this if I were going out and wanted to draw attention to myself because of its warm and inviting vibes. They call this scent innocent, which is far from the truth. Not a daytime scent for me, but it's definitely something I would want to wear on a special occasion.",4,Sephora,us
Angel,"Not everyone's type of perfume.

On second thought, I think it can be really useful as a weapon to keep people off (clingy kids, annoying people, etc). Caution: a small dose will do. It's extremely strong and extremely long-staying!",1,Sephora,us
Angel,"I've been wearing Angel for at least 2 years. I receive compliments every time I wear it, from people you would least suspect would offer a compliment, strangers and friends alike. This fragrance is sexy, seductive, fresh, flowery and musky both at the same time. It works well with my body chemistry. The only fragrance I wear since the first time I tried it. Love, love, love this perfume!!!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,I just started wearing this a few days ago and I love it! Such a unique and sexy scent. Put it on in the morning and it lasts all day long. I bought a bottle for my mom and she loves it too. :),5,Sephora,us
Angel,"This perfume was very strong when I first put it on, but after about 20-30 mins it smelled incredible! I always get compliments from this one. It lasts all day, too! I would definitely recommend it to anyone.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I have this for men and wanted to get it for my girlfriend. I like the product, but want to review the staff at the Sephora Store in the Annapolis Mall, MD.

I told the sales assistant I wanted it for my g/f and she hadn't had it before. I was sold the 'refill' bottle with a funnel inside. When I went back to exchange they tried to swap it for the mens refill!?! I told them I wanted the woman's spritz 1.7oz. They said they don't have that and brought me 4 of the $25 small botles. I went over and finally picked out the one I wanted myself. I was told I was making a mistake because it said 'refillable bottle"" on the box, I was buying another refill an thre is no such thing as 1.7oz woman's Angel that isn't a refill. I told them they were wrong and wanted it anyway. Needless to say when I got it home and it was opened it was the right 1.7oz spritz bottle. Next time I will shop online.",4,Sephora,us
Angel,"I am so picky when it comes to scents and I recently bought the fragrance sampler that Sephora offered that included this fragrance. At first sniff I was totally not into it.. it smelled very odd. I put it on my wrists and literally 10 minutes later it mellowed down into such a gorgeous warm vanilla chocolate fragrance! The patchouli makes the vanilla so much deeper and sexier.. I absolutely LOVE this perfume and think it's the best I've smelled besides Gucci Guilty, Burberry Brit and Givenchy Play :)",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"Tender, childhood memories, dreamlike? Really now!? I thought this would be feminine and soft, but I'm shocked. It's the opposite! It has a very woody & musky smell to it. This scent is manly and strong something I see my bf wearing, not something I would wear.",2,Sephora,us
Angel,"Soft and innocent? Soft and innocent my BUTT. This stuff is woodsy, spicy, and strong. Yes, you can smell the berries, and those are fine, but for me, it just isn't my thing. I'm more drawn to florals and I do like vanilla as well, but was a bit too strong for me. It's very very very sexy, so if you like strong, seductive scents, I'm sure you would love this. But if you're like me and you prefer the floral, lighter spectrum, be wary.",2,Sephora,us
Angel,"After reading a handful of reviews, I was intrigued about this scent. I purchased the small to-go size, as I did not want to commit to something I have not actually smelled.
I really love the way the scent mingles with my body chemistry, and over the course of the day changes. It starts off a little overwhelming and very sweet, and soon relaxes into a sweet, slightly earthy vanilla-ish scent. The scent is still on my skin the next day. I tend to be drawn to non-powdery Oriental fragrances. I am also one of those people who cannot wear florals (they smell very sour and soapy on me, in a bad way).
My husband is ambivalent about perfumes. He says this one is VERY obvious, and picks up on the Patchouli aspect of the perfume. In addition, he says the house stills smells like the perfume when he gets home from work (approximately 7 hours after I leave). He jokes that it smells like hippies...
I hope Angel grows on him... because I plan to buy the larger bottle once I use the small one I have.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"But I think I love it. ""Pure. Soft. Innocent""? Hah! Try ""Lusty. Wicked. Gender-bending."" Very juicy fruits on a bed of raspy, somewhat dirty patchouli and chocolate. Manic and slightly ludicrous. You'll buy the perfume thinking its Janet, and you end up with Dr. Frankenfurter, instead. And you'll probably be happier for it.

Never smelled anything as bold, vivid and vivacious as this. It's totally not me, but I think that's why I have to wear it.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"It's one of my fav!! It's smells like sour candy but its not sweet, almost like grape. It's hard to describe it's just awesome!!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,This perfume is very long lasting which I love. It only takes a little bit tho due to a little bit goes A LONG way.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"For me, it's a classic that will never go out of style. A little goes a long way and I love that I can still smell it on my skin at the end of the day. The mix of sweet and earthy is pitch perfect and uber sensual.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I got this as a sample with my sephora purchase. When I first smelled it straight out of the little tube, I thought it smelled great and was excited to try it on my skin and see what it smelled like. But I was very disappointed to find that it smelled HORRIBLE. I guess this perfume and my body chemistry do not mix. But the reason why I gave this two stars is because it was a good smell out of the bottle and I'm sure the scent will work for other people, plus it was an extremely long lasting scent. Of course that was very bad for me at the time, but would have been great if I enjoyed the smell. I can't stand perfumes that seem to fade completely away within minutes after spraying, and this perfume could still be smelled on my wrists even after trying to wash it off with soap three times!",2,Sephora,us
Angel,"I'm so sorry to everyone who loves this fragrance, but this is DISGUSTING. I get the notes of honey and chocolate, and there is nothing wrong with that. I think it's the patchouli that doesn't fit in here to me. I don't usually mind patchouli much, but it just makes this fragrance smell DIRTY. Like someone else said, it reminds them of tobacco doused with cheap perfume. But I'll go one step forward. I literally think it smells like a cigarette-smoker's car when they have one of those hideous cinnamon or vanilla pine tree air fresheners. Actually, I have a far more graphic and, er, ADULT description for it that is so bad I'd ask you for two forms of photo ID before I'd actually utter or type it. And it won't wash off!!! I went to the grocery store after one spritz of this and use three of those towelettes you're supposed to clean your cart with to scrub my arm. Then I got home and scrubbed my forearm with soap and water and I still can't get rid of it. I'm literally going to use bleach-water to try to get rid of it now. God, do I hate the store that didn't have those little cards you try perfume on. God, do I hate myself for even trying this! I'm very fragrance tolerant, so that's why I can't get over how much I hate this. I mean, it's bad. It's just really horribly, hideously, disgustingly, horribly bad. In case I've been vague, Angel is the most Foul Thing I Have Ever Smelled Outside Of A Zoo. And I hate it. Okay?",1,Sephora,us
Angel,"I have a hard time finding a scent that doesn't smell too young or fruity on me. This scent is absolutely perfect. EVERY single time i venture out after a fresh post-shower spritz i get stopped and complimented. My boyfriend cannot get enough of it, on me. Straight from the bottle nozzle, it smells like a funeral home. I don't understand how, but on skin...it just works.

It is very important to check this scent with your chemistry. This smells awesome on me, and yet it's horrid on my good friend.

Other scents i have used in the past include Calvin Klein Obsession - Night, Calvin Klein Euphoria, and Fresh Cannabis Santal. This is smokier/chocolate-y than all of these, and will last MUCH longer.

Scents that have NOT worked on me include 'boyfriend' which was too sweet and Ralph Lauren 'Ralph' which smelled like rotten pineapple.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"This is a very unique perfume. People (especially my boyfriend) LOVES this fragrance on me. My best friend annoyed by all the attention I was getting bought the same perfume, and it didn't work with her body chemistry as well. So she gave me her free bottle (yay!). I would encourage people to get a sample from a Sephora store, wear it for a couple of days before making a decision about it. I LOVE Angel!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I've heard the hype about this perfume for years, but never actually got around to trying it till a couple weeks ago. I sprayed some on in the store, and at first was horrified because the smell was incredibly strong and a little unpleasant.
However, once it dried, it smelled SO GOOD! I keep smelling my wrist (where I had sprayed it) because it smelled so wonderful. I will definitely be purchasing this product, it has a lovely scent that isn't overpowering at all, yet lasts all day (and I live in Arizona. I need a sweat-proof fragrance). Love it!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I agree with a previous reviewer that it smells like an older female smoker that has doused herself with a musky, cheap perfume to cover up the cigarette smell. It's also VERY hard to wash the smell away, so be careful where you place it the first time you try it.",1,Sephora,us
Angel,i honestly don't know how Thierry Mugler got away with this perfume. It smells horrid and disgusting. I sprayed it in the store on my skin and I honestly had the worst headache. The stench was so bad that even alcohol couldn't remove the stench. DON'T BUY!,1,Sephora,us
Angel,"This smells like a combination of cotton candy and phlegm... not altogether unpleasant, but really weird. A lot of people don't like me to wear it. I love Alien and Womanity by Thierry Mugler, but I'm really not sure about this. More points for the extreme longevity of the scent (which may or may not be a good thing) and the refillable bottles.",3,Sephora,us
Angel,"I've been looking for a signature scent for awhile, and nothing really grabbed me until this. I got this as a sample from Sephora and was instantly stunned at how unique it is. It's sweet without being too sweet and musky without being too musky. I have NEVER smelled anything like this. My boyfriend likes it. My mother likes it. My best friend who hates perfume even likes it. It's a surprising scent in a very pleasant way. I love wearing it.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"This is the first time I bought a fragrance based on written reviews, but it worked better than my usual method of sampling at a store. What a beautiful fragrance. It is distinctive, supremely balanced, heavenly. It is something I looked a lifetime for.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"Great, great , great",5,Sephora,us
Angel,This is my signature fragrance. When I am out and about I actually get stopped to ask if that wonderful fragrance is coming from me! I love Sephora's prices for this perfume.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,Angel is my favorite perfume! I've used it as my signature fragrance for years and still received compliments! It is not unusual for someone to stop me when I'm shopping and ask me what perfume I am wearing! Always adds a smile to my day...,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I recently recieved a sample of this with my last order.
I seriously love love love it! It's so different from anything I've smelled before. I can definetly smell the notes of chocolate and a bit of soft spicyness. It doesnt seem to last very long on my skin thougg, but doesnt give me a head ache like some.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I got a sample of this with my last order. I made the mistake of spritzing ONE spray on my hand. Worst mistake I ever made. It was so horrible and overwhelming and it just kept getting STRONGER. If i had to describe the smell, it was like that old random lady at family gatherings who is elderly and marinates herself in Charlie to cover up the smell of her Virginia Slims...you know when you have to be polite and hug that old lady hello? THAT is what this smells like. Its sorta overly sweet and musky and just completely overwhelming.

I felt like I was Pepe LePew and could almost SEE the halo of smelly waves emanating from me. I practically wanted to gnaw my arm off to get away from it.",1,Sephora,us
Angel,"Missed all of the notes that they said were in this besides the 'woody' scent. The bottle is deceptive, as well as the title. Does not remind me of an angel. I might give it a try on my skin, but so far I do not like it at all. Guess it's one of those love-hate ones. I would have loved to smell the chocolate and vanilla, but I didn't. And, it's not innocent or sexy. Icky.",2,Sephora,us
Angel,As a man I find this scent very attractive and sexy. It is Angelique but with a hint of naughtiness in it. Ladies-- men will love this on you !,4,Sephora,us
Angel,"This is likeable but I don't think I'd buy it. I got it as a sample and it's nice. It's kind of vanilla, kind of powdery, kind of patchouli... It's very soft on me, almost like a scented tissue box smell. It's not my style. I love Givenchy Play and Juicy Couture Viva La Joucy and they work nicely with my skin. This is also very similar to Lolita Lempicka, almost exact on me. Angel has more staying power though. It's a nice quality fragrance that hangs on and you can really smell it's notes as it settles into your skin. So, try it, it may become your fragrance. It's not really mine.",3,Sephora,us
Angel,This complex fragrance works well for me. I have been striking out lately - trying new fragrances that have not worked and have no staying power. My daughter wears this also and I love it on her as well.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"My boyfriends dad bought me this perfume and I absolutely hated it the first time I smelled it! But after a few hours of wearing it,I started to like it. After wearing it another day I LOVED IT! Its one of those that has to grow on you. Remember not every sent works for everyones skin ;)",5,Sephora,us
Angel,I got the sample today and thank god I didn't buy the perfume like I planned to. It smells like something my great grammie would wear...AT HER FUNERAL. Yuck.,1,Sephora,us
Angel,"This smelled like cheap old lady perfume, glad it was only a sample. If I had spent money on this, I would've been terribly disappointed.",1,Sephora,us
Angel,"This is my signature scent...has been for years.

I call it ""catch a man"" perfume because it is the only scent I wear that MEN compliment and comment on. In fact, it is how I ""got"" my guy...he says ""you smell better than anyone I have ever known"". I wear Angel 70% of the time and rotate other fragrances (Tom Ford Black Orchid, Agent Provocateur, Inner Grace, Coco) but when I ask him if he wants to smell something else on me he just says ""no, I want my Angel""...

It is sexy and beautiful BUT it doesn't work on everyone. I've had friends buy it and it didn't work on them (lucky me, they pass it on to me).

TRY A SAMPLE FIRST before you buy...it is a very unique scent but depending on your body chemistry it can smell amazing or awful.

I layer it...I use the shower gel, body lotion or spray oil, and the perfume. And I ALWAYS spray it in my hair (which my guy loves and will spend hours cuddling me just to sniff it on me and my hair)...and he always tells me I smell very very beautiful and sexy...nice!

It's not a fragrance for the faint of heart...

and my guy...he's 20 years my junior so it is NOT an old lady scent...just sexy and pretty...",5,Sephora,us
Angel,This scent really didn't agree with me at all and my man also hated it.,2,Sephora,us
Angel,"5 star product with 3 star packaging. I typically do not wear perfume, and have been receiving many samples from my online purchases from Sephora (Sephora offers mostly perfume). I get to try many and have to say, most are a one time use / disappointing and well, the reason I do not wear perfume. I got the Angel as a sample, and then used 100 pts to buy a small bottle that stands up on its own. I LOVE the scent, and find myself using it daily. It is so nice, does not smell to strong, sweet, etc but blends really nicely I hardly notice it (but LUV it). I went ahead and bought the bit 1.7 Oz STAR Angel and, well, it doesn't stand up on its own (rather needs some sort of stand?). Not sure why this is packaged this way. I like the packaging of the smaller star from my 100 pt bonus perk. The bottle should sit upright. Still LUV the perfume. This will be my scent forever as it has taken me this long to find one that I can use and love (I also like Donna Karen but do not LOV it). Gotta LUV a fragrance or why where it at all?",4,Sephora,us
Angel,Got a sample of this and sprayed it on my wrist. Smelled absolutely awful a first but got a little better after it dried. But I still didn't like it. Has a strong staying power because I've showered and I can still smell it. Gives me a headache.,1,Sephora,us
Angel,"Try before you buy. This is an oriental, with a warm spicy smell, and yes, it is strong. I am one to read reviews, and I've learned no matter how many reviews you read- whether they're positive or negative- you must try things for yourself. To me, this perfume is a definite never.",3,Sephora,us
Angel,"I'm a big fan of oriental scents as well as gourmands so when Angel appeared on the menu of free samples, I snatched it up to see what all the fuss was about. The sample came in a small cardboard box, which is a nice touch I'm always happy to see; little somethings to show the company cares really makes products stand out to me.
When I first applied this perfume, it was super-strong and very spicy. At first sniff I thought I'd made a mistake--it smelled like something for a much older woman. Immediately, though, the strong notes began to wear down and a gorgeous drydown scent was left on my wrists. The scent that you actually end up wearing is unique but still very soft--I smelled a lot of the vanilla and patchouli.
Overall, it's very warm and sexy while still a little spicy and unique. I had never been interested in this scent before because by glancing at the bottle it didn't look like something I would wear, but I really do love this scent. If it were a touch more long-lasting, I'd buy the full-size bottle without hesitation.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I typically do not wear perfume. With my Sephora orders, I end up picking my free samples in perfume (as that is what Sephora mostly offers). I got this as a sample, and LOVED it so much, I bought a smaller bottle. It just seems to natural, and as I have tried dozens of other samples from Sephora, I have decided this is the only one I really want to wear (and I want to wear this one). Not sure what it is that makes it so nice, but I am sold",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I bought Angel by Thierry Mugler because it smelled so divine on my friend. Big mistake!! When I purchased mine, I got the largest bottle I could find- another big mistake! I found out I could not stand it at all. The smell on me was just unbearable. I didn't want to let go of something I spent so much on, but I also could never breathe each time I had it on. I gave it to my sister- that was in 2007. I tried to smell the fragrance again recently at a departmental store just to make sure I did the right thing but NO, absolutely no regrets at all. I did the right thing. But one thing I cannot take away from this fragrance is the fact that it smells soooo good, so yummy in fact on certain people, but on me, it just fell flat.",2,Sephora,us
Angel,"I got this as a gift. I do not like most perfumes, and have so many samples from Sephora (I do alot of online ordering). This is so pretty and light, I love it. The jar is cute, but I have to say I love whats inside. It is very light, and has good staying power without being overpoweriing.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"Glorious, lovely, rich gourmand masterpiece of a fragrance! This fragrance is VERY strong, however, which really has a polarizing effect that leads people to completely love it or completely hate it.

I had read the description long before I actually smelled the perfume, and frankly I expected something candy-cake-y. WRONG. This is the most mature, decadent scent that balances its sweetness with an almost masculine heart...swoon.

It is unlike anything out there, and even for those who do not like heavy or food-type scents, it's certainly worth a smell. Like it or not, Angel is a MASTERPIECE.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"This is a wonderful perfume, it does have a strong start, that may put some people off, but give it a few minutes and the dry down transform into the most, IMO, addictive scent. It is a more complicated perfume, it changes through the day. And just a little will do you all day, unless your love it and are bold enough to use more.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,This scent lasts alllllllllllllllll day and is simply a dessert for your skin.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"This smells like pine trees on me.
I don't know about you, but I don't like smelling like a car air-freshener.",1,Sephora,us
Angel,Does anyone else think this smells like Skin-so-Soft? It reminds me of being nine-years-old and my mom spraying it on me before I go to play outside to keep the bugs off. I gave it 3 stars because Skin-so-Soft is not the worst smelling bug spray out there.,3,Sephora,us
Angel,One of the Best! The fragrance is a wonderful combination of components.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,I received this as a premium sample. One spray and I gave it to one of my coworkers. It is entirely too strong. I didn't find it appealing at all. It reminded me or Charlie.,1,Sephora,us
Angel,I got this as a sample from my sister and I fall in love with this scent. The first night I wore the small sample I got tons of compliments from people so I decided to buy this. I bought the refillable bottle because it makes sense to just buy that and then buy refill bottles when this actually runs out. This fragrance last all day!,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"Angel is an amazing perfume that seems to smell a little different every time I wear it! My husband loves it too! Last night at 10 p.m., he told me that my Angel smelled amazing, and I had put it on at 7 a.m. that morning. It usually starts out with a kind of honey spice smell on me and turns a little more floral and fruity as the day goes on. By night it dries down to a warm vanilla and has hints of Lolita Lempicka. The key for me is to spray it moderately, and to spray it only on my body (one spray on my stomach, one on my chest and one on the back of my neck), not in my hair. It works well with my body chemistry, but smells too strong in my hair.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I've packed up my Channel, my Fendi, my Cartier and my Boucheron. THIS IS IT! A fabulous scent that lingers when I leave a room and identifies me as a contemporary and sexy woman. I ADORE IT.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I used to looove this perfume and made it my signature scent. Unfortunately, I had several people tell me I smelled like an old lady with it on (Hard to take for a 24 year-old- I wore it in my early twenties up until then). Also, it seemed some people just couldn't stand the way it smelled on me. maybe it was my chemistry, but i liked it anyway! I loved the warmth and richness of the scent, especially the patchouli and vanilla/chocolate. I also loved the drydown of berries. I sometimes miss wearing this, but at least I found viva la juicy to replace it, which i am even more obsessed with! The woman who wears this must be confident and only wear perfume for herself.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,I have worn Angel for over 10 years. I never fail to get compliments on the fragrance when I have it on. The scent from the body cream seems to lasts forever.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I have to be a 100% honest with all you females out there, it smells like flat out eggnog. Now, everytime I was passing any fragrance store I took a whiff for about a year, never being able to quite putting my finger on it. Now I have it, its exactly the smell of eggnog. I personally like eggnog, but I know many, many dont. Its quite sweet, quite powdery, but interesting. Its really your call ladies, its certainly a love-hate perfume for everyone.",3,Sephora,us
Angel,"I first smelled Angel when I was in a rental office on one of the leasing agents. She gave me the name of Parfum. Went to the store and purchase it, the fragance lasted all day . I am sold...",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"The only reason I gave this any stars at all was because of the pretty bottle! I wore it to school and everyone teased me and told me I smelled like old spice. Now my nickname is old spice, the only thing I have to say is that whoever made this perfume has ruined my social status.",1,Sephora,us
Angel,"By far, this is the best fragrance in my collection. When I wear this fragrance, I have people compliment me and ask me, ""What cologne are you wearing?"" It is warm, sensual, and lasts all day. It is not a bottle filled with alcohol - it is the real deal!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,I got this as a sample and I was a little unsure because I'm very picky about perfumes I wear. Love this scent. Very spicy! Stays on ALL day! The only reason I gave it four stars is because even the littlest amount is SO strong.,4,Sephora,us
Angel,Best perfume I ever bought. I have been wearing it for years and still get compliments. Try it and you'll love it.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I really dislike Thierry Muglers fragrances. My father got this for my mother on her birthday after going into a shop which told him it was one of the sexiest and most popular sents sold, and that if she were ever in paris the bottle would be refiled for free. she recived it and it smelled very clinical almost like an inhalers atomizer, she asked me if i would try it and it smelled like sweat but not in a sexy sweet musky sort of way in a unbathed crack sort of way (please don't ask me how i know that) IT WAS BAD!!!! and I have had similar happening with his other fragrances one of which i forget the name for but it smelled like gingersnaps and dried spit, it reminded me of the dentists office and i couldn't take it. these child hood memories that the fragrance claims to evoke are not ones i wish to relive nor dose my mother",1,Sephora,us
Angel,"hated it when i smelled it on paper but after wearing it on my wrist and letting it settle in i couldnt stop smelling it. However my friend asked for a spritz when she smelled it on me and we both hated it on her. Like with every other perfume it smells totally different on each person. you will either love it with your chem or hate it. TRY BEFORE YOU BUY.

ps. not for those who like light flowery scents. its very heavy and intoxicating",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"i absolutely almost throw up when i first smelled it , even before i tried on, then i decided to give it a try with my body chemistry involved.. and the 2nd thought was the worst, it smell like super sweet cheap candy and remind me of those old grandma trying to do some candy shopping for their grandkids. i mean, srsly? i am only 22, and by using this i feel i am 72. Maybe i was expecting too much out of this one, it listed under ""woody"" so i just assumed something different .. not this sweet... however, this is doesn't smell that bad especially after i put it on, i just don't enjoy the oldfashion+sweet smell.. for girls who likes it , well i would say different people like different things...",2,Sephora,us
Angel,"I got this as a 100 point perk sample. It smelled great in the bottle but when I put it on I was kinda disappointed with it. It didn't smell bad but it didn't smell all too great either. It was vanilla-y but way to much and after five minutes began to resemble what is best described as a bottle of vanilla if it went bad. However, my best friend also tried it and it smells really nice on her. It's safe to say that this is definitely not a perfume for everyone so try it before you buy it.",3,Sephora,us
Angel,I got this for Christmas and i ended up giving it away to a friend. It stunk so bad. I don't think I have ever encounted a perfume like this before. The bottle is really nice and I love all of the other perfumes by Thierry Mugler. It really is a fragrance you either love or hate. No middle ground with this one!,1,Sephora,us
Angel,"Long lasting, dreamy perfume. This could well be the sexiest perfume I have ever had the pleasure of wearing.

P.S. It's not even overwhelming!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,Angel Has a fruity fragrance. It's almost like a fruit candy type of sense. Even though it smells good enough to eat it still has a clean crisp smell to it as well. Angel is a very well fitting name.,4,Sephora,us
Angel,"I have been wearing Angel for a few years now. It is my all-time favorite smell. I get many complements! It has a very spicey, patchouli scent...YUM!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"the first time I sniffed this fragrance was after I got a free sample of it with a sephora order. I was curious to try it since it seems to be a favorite for so many people. I tried it on my wrist and was so disgusted by the smell that I had to have a shower to wash it off. that was 2 years ago when I was going through my fruity-floral perfume stage. So as I was sorting through my old fragrance samples, I rediscovered this...I remembered the first time I smelled it but was once again curious about it...I applied it to my wrist again and was struck with shock at how lovely it smelled! I can't wait to get my hands on a full size bottle now!!",4,Sephora,us
Angel,"I liove it, most important mens love it !!!!!!!

My suggetion is dont bother bying a stand.I use a oval medium??? size glass candel top.Just take top off put on ur dresser insert star :-)",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"The pretty bottle was what drew me in, but the manly scent is what made me decide against buying this perfume. I love Thierry Mugler's ""Womanity"". It's amazing, but Angel is really musky and masculine.",1,Sephora,us
Angel,"This may work on some people, but on me it is almost the worst smell I have ever experienced. I mean that. It smells like rotten weeds!",1,Sephora,us
Angel,"The Angel bottle is a bit awkward on a shelf of vanity, and it's so pretty that I don't like it just laying there, so I decided to get the bottle holder. At first I thought, ""why couldn't the bottle just be designed to stand?"". I still don't know the answer to that, but it is what it is. Now that I have the stand, I like that the bottle didn't stand on it's own. The way the stand is made, it displays the bottle. beautifully!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I have been wearing Angel for many years. I t is my absolute favorite perfume. I have tried other scents by Thierry Mugler, but by far the traditional ANGEL is the best. I love the way it smells and receive many compliments on its scent. You will not be disappointed.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"This is an awesome and interesting scent but its not for everyone. You need to be able to carry it. When I first smelt it on one of the paper things, I was disgusted. I got a sample size as a gift and I decided to put a little on my skin and after 10-15 minutes, I was sold. It definitely smells differently in the bottle and on the actual skin.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I had been wanting to try this for quite a while. I did a search for fragrances with high notes of Patchouli, which is my absolute favorite! I finally purchased a bottle and have simply fallen in love! I've been wearing Estee' Lauder Youth Dew for years but wanted a change. This is my new signature! When I first spray it it reminds me of my grandpa's pipe tobacco, which is a very comforting scent for me. Once it dries, it has a very warm, lovely smell. I can definitely pick up the patchouli, but the chocolate mixed with it is heavenly. A little more expensive than the Youth Dew, but well worth it.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"Let me first start by saying I Love Alien and I love Angel Innocent, but Angel on me was always a powerhouse of patchouli and not much more. I tried spraying it really far away from my arm...didn't help, so I pretty much gave up and decided Angel was not for me. One day I was shopping in Kohl's and this lady was shopping in the same general area I was and she smelled soooooooo good!!! I never ask folks what scent they're wearing even though I've been tempted on more than one occasion. That lady could not leave without me kmowing what she was wearing so I got brave and approached her and asked, she was more than happy to tell me she was wearing Angel! I tucked that tidbit away and went on with my life, 6 months later (2 days ago), I was reading all the reviews on Fragrantica and here on Angel and decided to give my sample bottle another go....but I decided to apply it like I apply D&G The One, I spray one spray on a q-tip then stroke it on my inner wrists, between my boobs, and above my belly button (and sometimes behind my ears). That seemed to work!!! My 2 sniffer sons both loved it and my husband thought it was ""nice"". I can still smell the patchouli but it's not a gagging smell anymore, it's actually pleasant, and the drydown is very nice, almost calming, vanilla-ish. This is not a sweet perfume on me, which is good because I have and love tons of very sweet perfumes, if I want it a bit sweeter I layer it with Innocent or even God help me, Hello Kitty perfume (that stuff is great!). I would highly recommend anyone interested in Angel to not buy it blind, chemistry seems to be a big deciding factor in perfume espically with Angel. Try it on, live with it for a few days and then make the decision to buy or pass...Sephora is usually very generous with samples so trying it on numerous times is possible, perfume ain't cheap so make darn sure you like it first. I will be buying a full sized bottle of Angel but will apply with a light hand.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,This is absolutely fabulous. The lotion makes your skin feel like silk and lasts all day. The bonus is the scent lasts all day as well.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"This has been my favorite fragrance for about 8 years or so. I got spritzed while walking thru a dept. store one day and really wasn't crazy about it until about an hour later when I kept smelling this fantastic scent. When I realized it was coming from me, I knew I had to get it. I bought the refillable bottle and I'm glad I did. It's the only fragrance that I will never be without. It's soft and sexy, love the chocolate and patchouli, a little goes a long way (only use 1 spray or 2) and has great staying power. I went to a job interview after working all day and was told ""You're the best smelling candidate I've ever interviewed."" I won't attribute having gotten the job to Angel, but it didn't hurt. :)

I use it year round but not every day because I have so many other great fragrances too, at least three that are still in the box, lol. I've received more compliments than I can count from men and women. I can't say that about any other fragrance I've ever used. My job requires close contact with others and I'm always told how good I smell. The only issue I've ever had were with a couple people who have allergies. So if you or someone you're around all the time has allergies, this might not be for you.

I've tried some of the other Mugler fragrances and so far, they were not for me. I am going to try Womanity when I get a chance though.

Some of my other favorites are L by Lolita and Victoria's Secret Sexy Little Things Noir. These two are a little like Angel, but don't attract as much attention. I also like most Lancome fragrances, Dolce & Gabbana's light blue (great) for summer and Chanel's Coco Mademoiselle. Both are magnetic like Angel.

The French do fragrance best and Thierry Mugler is the ""Star"" among them. I highly recommend this fragrance.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I have been wearing this fragrance exclusively for the past 10 years and always, I mean ALWAYS, get complimented on the scent!!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"This wasn't initially my favorite (I am more of an Alien girl). However, I received a sample and my picky finance loved it. I bought a bottle immediately. It is definitely a winter scent, but I always get compliments from men whenever I wear it. I have long hair and tend to perfume my hair instead of my skin. I feel like I get more staying power that way (I don't use any products on my hair so no competing scents)",5,Sephora,us
Angel,Angel is my all time favorite perfume and the only one that I will wear. I get constant compliments on how nice it smells. My niece was the one you introduce me to Angel and I thank her quite often for doing so.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"Got a wonderful Sephora gift coupon that saved $15.00 towards a delicious purchase of Angel. Gave this to my sister as this perfume is her all time fav! Plus I received all kinds of samples as an ""insider"" wow!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I bought Angel after reading its great reviews and have not been disappointed. When I tested it in the store, I wasn't crazy about the scent at first but it actually smells better a little while after application. It is a very unique scent and has excellent staying power.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I have been wearing this perfume for a few years now as a recommendation from a friend. It smells different on everyone, which gives it a unique smell for each person. Every time I wear it I get complimented. It is a very sweet yet spicy smell on me and it is not too overpowering but every once in a while it will hit me and it smells fantastic:)",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I can't say too much more about this scent that hasn't been said. I am a HUGE Theirry Mugler fan. Before Angel I bought Alien. This is a little softer, but has every bit the same staying power. I have dry, fair skin and one little spray does the job.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,I bought the small .25 purse size because I ran out of my large bottle and was all I could afford. Very happy with it and it arrived quickly!,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"i requested/recieved this for christmas, after reading rave reviews, expecting it to smell...well, ""sexy."" it smells like very men's cologne in the bottle -- not for me.
however, i wore it anyway, knowing that scents change after they're sprayed and react with the chemicals in the skin. it smelled amazing, and my boyfriend admitted that he was turned on by the scent.
love LOVE it!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I have a huge selection of high end perfumes and tend to switch my scent up however, I don't know why. Every time I wear this, I get at least 1 compliment- and from men and women. I love that the bottle is refillable too! Way to go green and smell good at the same time!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I have been wearing this perfume for several years now, and I constantly get compliments on the scent. It is soft, powdery and yet lasts all day.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"Just love this perfume - it is soft, sweet not over powering. It is my little indulgence -worth the price since at has a unique scent. I always get compliments on it and now people now me by my Angel perfume.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,Had these parfume for over 10years... Always complimented or ask what is it...,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"The sophisticated combination of the scents make this fragrance so amazing. And it has staying power -- the scent lasts through the day for me.

I tend to wear it most during the winter, but it's a great perfume for any season.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,Love this fragrance! Super Sexy.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,I absolutely LOVE this perfume! Angel has a clean scent that makes you smell shower fresh. With hints of spices it is the perfect blend of exotic and comforting.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"This is not for everyone. Try it before you buy. I use one spray and it lasts 24 hours, it's very strong if you use more. This works with my body chemistry and smells amazing on me. Men and women both love it. My husband who hates fragrance loves this too. I have had my 3.4 oz bottle for two years, so you will get a lot for the money.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,Angel is all wear now. The lotion leaves a light scent all day.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"it's a pretty perfume, it lingers with you all day, which i love!",4,Sephora,us
Angel,I found this perfume in France about 20 years ago and was immediately hooked. Before it was available in this country I would actually send away for it to Europe - that's how great it is. I always get compliments and it definitely drives men crazy.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I absolutely love this fragrance, I get so many comments.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"This is my all-time favorite fragrance. It lasts FOREVER, and smells heavenly. Guess that's why it's called Angel! LOL.. I always, always get comments & questions about my perfume when I wear it. Everyone loves it and it drives men crazy ;-)",5,Sephora,us
Angel,i absolutely adore this classic scent. not everyone can pull it off. it's bold & chic & not for those who are prone to getting headaches from wearing a fragrance (it's not light at all). it lasts all day/night & lingers on my clothing. beautiful!,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"At first I was afraid to try Angel because I tend to purchase ""safe"" floral scents. Well I decided to try it and I love it. Very sexy and decadent.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"best fragrance EVER, I started to use this when I was teenager, I'm now 31 and I still love it. warm and sweet can't go wrong.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I purchased the 0.23 oz mini-spray on a whim because I had heard good things about it, and I'm really enjoying it. It is a fairly unique fragrance that's sensual but not overpowering and not too sweet. The scent is fairly long-lasting and 1-2 sprays is more than enough. Will definitely consider buying a full-size bottle.",4,Sephora,us
Angel,My favourite perfume in a travel spray for my purse - perfect!,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I have always admired women that can wear Angel well and wasn't sure if I could be one of them. I first tried it on my wrist for an afternoon after a wonderful sales guy walked me through several vanilla-based fragrances. I wore it pretty darn well, so I decided to buy the purse-sized Angel a week later. Just fun little note, Angel is one of the only (if not THE only) purse-sized fragrance that actually comes in a spray and not a rollerball. So, the verdict?? I use 1 spray near my heart chakra everyday and it lasts the ENTIRE DAY. It's not as overwhelming as I thought it would be! And I love catching a dash of the Angel as the lovely vanilla and patchouli waft from my heart chakra late in the day. SO glad I bought it! Can't wait to buy the full size once the purse spray is gone.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I like this perfume for the winter months. The plus, it lasts all day. But beware, a light spritz will do -- anymore is overwhelming!",4,Sephora,us
Angel,"I was totally skeptical about purchasing such a high ticket fragrance without actually smelling it. I read the reviews and figured that I would immediately be blown away by its sheer awesomeness.
I wasn't. Not even close. When I first applied it (very sparingly, 1 small spritz), my bathroom was bombarded by something hideous smelling. It reminded me of bug spray. I was horrified and thought about furiously washing it off with Lava soap. Instead, I waited about a half an hour just to say that I tried it.
AMAZING! I had no idea that the bug spray odor would disapate into what it did. I can smell chocolate and something woodsy. It's heavy but applied in small doses, it shouldn't be offensive. It's very unique but not unpleasantly so. I will never EVER apply this in a rush and fly out the door. Waiting for the dry down is the key. Def. a winter fragrance. I'm sold!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I love this scent in extreme moderation: Only half of a full spray. Anymore and the earthy notes (patchouli and coumarin) take over and annoy myself as well as others. With just a half spray it is sweet, soft and lightly mossy. Very yummy. The hair mist is also great along with the gentle body powder, though the glitter in it is overwhelmingly loud.",4,Sephora,us
Angel,"I have been an Angel devotee since my first bottle in 1999. I had just moved to South Florida from a little town in Western KY and discovered Angel, and this small town girl fell in love with it instantly! And, the day I purchased my first bottle there was a man who would etch something on the bottle for you. I had my name etched on there. I always get compliments when I wear Angel. And, even after wearing it for 11 years, I still fall in love with Angel everytime I wear it.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,I received a sample of this with an in store purchase. I got so many compliments on it that I had to go back and get it. I love this,5,Sephora,us
Angel,Imagine my surprise when I recently discovered that 2 of my dear friends are also in love with Angel! This is a fragrance for adults who appreciate the finer things in life. Angel is a rich scent with depth and intrigue and staying-power. It's all I'll wear this fall and winter!,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"Angel definitely has great lasting power, and it's a pretty decent fragrance. I was expecting a different kind of scent, however. It's nice anyway, give it a try!",3,Sephora,us
Angel,"I have loved this fragrance for years. It's the one perfume that every time I wear it, someone asks ""are you wearing Angel? I love it!"". Well, I love it, too. It not only is a very unique perfume, it lasts much longer during the day than any other I wear. I bought one of those Sephora roller-ball refills and use it for Angel for an end-of-the-day ""fix"".",5,Sephora,us
Angel,when i wear this i have people actually stop me to ask what I'm wear so they can buy it or so they can get it for their girlfriends or wives. I have officially been wearing it for 10 years now and will always LOVE it!,5,Sephora,us
Angel,I cannot stand this perfume. It has a strong powdery smell that leaves me nauseous. This fragrance reminds me of a grandma with a large flowery church dress. Not sexy at all. Complete FAIL,1,Sephora,us
Angel,"This is my very favorite scent. I get compliments from people, even strangers, who want to know what I am wearing. I wear only Angel!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"One of the best scents but I'm also an Alien fan. Angel grabs attention from people passing by. I was out with my cousin and his friends, and they absolutely loved the scent. Definitely smells like sophstication but sexy and alluring at the same time",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"This has to be one of the worst smelling perfumes I have smelled it's more like a Mans cologne,,bought the rollerball what a waste of money for me..:-(",1,Sephora,us
Angel,I love this scent! It's lite and fresh. I wear it every day and get tons of compliments!,5,Sephora,us
Angel,I only wear Angel and at least twice a week I have someone comment on how great I smell and am asked what I am wearing!! It's the only perfume I have been wearing for 7 years!,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"Spices, chocolate and patchouli (not hippie patchouli, more of a sophisticated take on it) are what I smell when wearing this. It is one of my winter fragrances. Love it.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"i STARTED WEARING ANGEL ABOUT 3 YEARS AGO,
I GET AT LEAST 3 COMPLIMENTS A WEEK.
BY FAR THIS IS MY MOST FAV SCENT,
I USED TO WEAR PACHOULI ALL THE TIME IN MY TEENS SO THIS BRINGS BACK A LOT OF MEMORIES",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I have been wearing Angel for a few years now and honestly... it is the ONLY one I wear. I wear it to work and at night. I have never worn a perfume that gets noticed as much as this one. Everyone that smells me, or notices the scent all LOVE the smell and ask what kind it is.

I hope it is never discontinued because I would/will wear it for life!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,I am so glad that Sephoa offers a small version of this perfume. I rediscovered Angel recently and had to get some to have on hand. It is just as great as I remember it!,5,Sephora,us
Angel,This fragance is sweet and delicate.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,I have worn Angel off and on for over 10 years.... and have gotten lots of compliments Although... i really cant smell it after 10 min or so..... but i ve been told that when a scent is perfect for you ... you cant smell it but i dont know if thats actually true... but anyway i like it !,5,Sephora,us
Angel,Angel has a strong musky smell so you don't need much. It also has staying power. I love the rollerball.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"ONe of my closest friends wears this perfume, no one likes it its absolutely revulting. It must be an acquired taste, that many people under 30 shouldnt wear",1,Sephora,us
Angel,A few month's before the love of my life passed away he went shopping with me to help me choose a new fragrance. He always called me his angel girl and after trying scent after scent he finally chose Angel. When he chose it he didn't know the name of the fragrance but said that it was a perfect match in all ways. I will wear Angel until the day I go on to Heaven to join him.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,This is one of my favorite go to scents. I wear it when i want to be noticed!,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I discovered this scent on a trip to London about 13 years ago and have been wearing it ever since. I'm not a big floral- OR musky-scent kind of girl so when I smelled this, I fell in love. I wear this almost every time I go out at night and it never fails, someone always asks me ""What are you wearing, you smell so good!"" - both guys and girls alike. I also like that this stays throughout the night, since I hate having to douse myself in perfume just to make sure it's not gone in an hour. To that end, I usually don't wear it during the day simply because it's a heavier, almost sexier (I feel) scent - unless I have an after work date.

I have mixed feelings about giving this such a great review because I rarely run into people who have heard about ""Angel"" so I don't want other people to discover my ""secret""!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,I get so many compliments when I wear Angel. It meshes with me perfectly. Stays in my perfume collection. N.B.: I am super picky about scents.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,I have always loved this perfume it is so wonderful I always come back to it.,4,Sephora,us
Angel,"At first when I spritzed on Angel, I was surprised by the peppery smell. Sound familiar, negative reviews? But I decided to give it a chance, so I walked around the mall for a half hour or so. By the time I was ready to go, the perfume had calmed down a bit and smelled AMAZING. Like nothing else really. I encourage everyone to give Angel a try! Strong at first, then super addictive :). Enjoy!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"Smells like spicy pepper and powder mixed together. I don't know why the pepper smell is in there, but it's PUNGENT and absolutely horrible! I couldn't wait to get this stuff washed off my arm!!",1,Sephora,us
Angel,"This fragrance is sexy, sensual, sweet, everything that woman should smell like all rolled into a pretty star shaped bottle! My holy grail of perfumes! It doesn't get better than this!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I HAVE HAD A ZILLION COMPLIMENTS USING THIS FRAGRANCE! MOSTLY FROM MEN, AND THE OCCASIONAL MAN WHO TOLD HIS WIFE IN FRONT OF ME- :I WANT YOU TO SMELL LIKE HER""!
NOTHING BEATS 'ANGEL' , WHICH IS WHY IT CONTINUES TO BE THE NUMBER ONE FRAGRANCE!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,This scent is not for me. I'm so disappointed because of all the wonderful reviews. in my opinion this perfume was TOO heavy and it reminded me of something my grandmother used to wear.,1,Sephora,us
Angel,"The price is reasonable for the amount of perfume. I like that it is a spray and not a roll-on purse size. The scent is heavier than I remember. Not a good summer perfume, but I look forward to it this winter.",3,Sephora,us
Angel,"Because of the rave, I got a free sample from sephora to try it out. I tried it on the next day and WOW. I love this smell. Normally, I don't like floral perfumes because the smell was too strong for my nose, but this one is fine! I got complements from a lot of people, including my mother and grandmother who usually HATES perfumes XD",5,Sephora,us
Angel,This is a beautiful scent that is refreshing and sweet smelling.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"It's that kind of scent you can't really put your finger on- it's neither floral nor fruity nor woody- but I know it smells amazing. The bottle is gorgeous, and worth every penny.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"Angel is one-of-a-kind. It is not floral, but it's not strictly citrus.... yet, it appeals to afficionados of both genres. The first commercial fragrance to incorporate a chocolate note, it 's spawed a huge number of clones - but you owe it to yourself to try the original, and the best.

It's a perfume that had me wondering for months ""What IS that 'thing' I'm smelling in there?"" And one that nearly everyone loves to smell someone wear.

It's mild enough for teens, but mature enough for women of any age to wear. If you're a fan of Lolita Lempicka, please look for this and give it a try.

Mugler collaborated with the movie ""Perfume"" to create one of the most mythic fragrance sets ever created, including taking on the challenge of creating the scent of a human.... I can't imagine another perfumer with the imagination to even try. Angel is far more accessible - and cheaper. A modern masterpiece, and a true original.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"My all-time favorite perfume, Angel by Thierry Mugler, now also available in a vial to carry in my purse. Love it.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I just can't change my perfume...it's the best fragrance!
This small size is perfect! Goes everywhere with me.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,Angel has been my signaature scent for years. I've sprayed it into little containers to take w/me on trips etc. No more! Now I can buy it in a pen sized take along that even fits into my purse. What could be better?,5,Sephora,us
Angel,Best perfume of all time.The first time I smelled it I thought that the stars in heaven had come down to earth..,5,Sephora,us
Angel,I liked this when I first smelled it... after wearing for just a few minutes it smelled musky and kind of dirty. yuck.,1,Sephora,us
Angel,"This is my new favorite for sure. I don't know how I missed out on this fragrance but I must say how excited I am to have found my signature scent. If you like notes of musk, chocolate, amber and pachouli you will love this. What I love most about it is that every time I wear it I smell different parts of it and I get compliments on it almost everyday I wear it. This is a multi faceted beautiful scent, very excited to have found it!!!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"This has a very aromatic scent, which mixes well with my chemistry. A dab in all the right places and I'm good to go, . . . all day.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,I have used Angel for years and have discovered that the scent lasts longer when you layer it with the lotion. This lotion has been updated and now lasts longer.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,As much hype as I read about this- I was disappointed it didn't work for me. I have yet to hear a bad review! It might be me! ALOT of fragrances change on me.,4,Sephora,us
Angel,"I've been wearing this perfume for years. It's the only one I own. It smells of vanilla, chocolate, patchouli, and magic. If you like the musky vanilla scents you are going to fall in love with Angel.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"This perfume is fantastic. Smells great - all the time. I always get compliments! It's long lasting, and I can't bring myself to every wear anything different.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,The best thing aside from it smelling amazing is the fact that it last ALLLL DAY... AND ALL THE COMPLIMENTS!!!,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I love angel. its spicy, cocoa-y, and sweet all at once. It's really fantastic.",4,Sephora,us
Angel,Have been wearing this parfume for years now....took a break for a while when my kittens broke my bottle all over....just purchased again and STILL enamored by it's array of scents. Delic!!!,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"The Angel scent is distinct & recognizable. Some people love it, others can't stand the fragrance. On warm, humid Summer days this isn't what I choose to wear. But, when in a cooler environment & the temps in the low 80s or in an air-conditioned place I love it. For me, it's intriguing & makes me feel beautiful.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,I love this perfume. It smells very sweet and may be a bit heavy for the day time. I wear it when I go out at night and stick to a lighter fragrance for the daytime.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,I love love love love this!!! Bought one for myself and for cousin- we are both angel lovers!! Now I can refresh that awesome scent through the night and keep the love going :),5,Sephora,us
Angel,"Love the great scent--long lasting without overpowering. Having received a compliment when wearing Angel, I, then gave the purse size spray to that same person so they too could enjoy it as much as I do.",4,Sephora,us
Angel,Great experience. Helpful staff. I was looking for a fragrance that would be all my own. And they helped me find angel. I know it's been around awhile but it is my new favorite.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"This is my favorite fragrance, bar none! I receive compliments galore, even from people who don't like the fragrance for themselves. Each stage of Angel compliments my chemistry and personality beautifully. Love it, love it, love it!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"After an hour or two the chocolate topnote gets pretty intense on me. I have been complimented on this but, I'm not sure I want to smell like a Hershey bar.",4,Sephora,us
Angel,It's hard to write a review for perfume as I think it smells different on everyone. But Angel is beautiful.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,I absolutely LOVE this perfume! People comment all the time how wonderful it smells. It lasts all day long. It was relatively easy to refill my star.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,compliments galore every time I wear this scent,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"This is my second Thierry Mugler Angel but my first was the small size. I love the scent but this larger bottle's sprayer puts out too much perfume--much more than I want and much more than the small bottle. Next time, I'll stick with the tiny size.",4,Sephora,us
Angel,"I was disappointed with this perfume. It smleed like vamilla, eve after the dry down. I do not care at all for it. I LOVE perumes and prefer not to wera something that smell like it belongs in the kitchen--in the cabinet!!",2,Sephora,us
Angel,"This is one of those perfumes that need to mellow out before you can really discover it's characteristic. This one is definitely very oriental, the honey note is very dominate to me. The fragrance has a very nostalgic feel, it's an unique perfume. Not an universal scent, it's not a safe perfume to buy for someone, it's definitely made for a specific type of person. For me I do prefer more feminine floral fragrances, I was fortunate to test it out when I was gifted the product.",4,Sephora,us
Angel,I love this scent...it's so unique and exotic.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"A little strong for daywear, but great for evening. I can't stand anything with patchouli in it, but this smells so good that I can tolerate it easily.",4,Sephora,us
Angel,"I HAVE A FULL BOTTLE OF ANGEL THAT I HAVE HAD ON MY DRESSER FOR A YEAR, I CANNOT WEAR IT! I GET AN INSTANT HEADACHE... MY MOM WEARS IT OFTEN AND I TELL HER IT SMELLS GROSS, APPARENTLY YOU EITHER LOVE IT OR HATE IT!",1,Sephora,us
Angel,"I am a perfume junkie. I have worn this fragrance for years, and it is the one I always get compliments on. You only need one spritz, more than that and it is too strong. Also, it smells different on different people, which I guess is common of most perfumes. Simply the best for me!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I have ONLY worn Angel for the last 6 years and I get at least one compliment every day. I will pay any price for this scent. I use the bath gel then the body cream and then the perfume to create an all day and into the evening scent people recognize me by. Ask for a sample next time you are shopping in Sephora, you too will fall in love with Angel",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I bought this for my mom after her favorite perfume, Fendi, had been discontinued. I thought she would never wear anything else! It is quite pricey, but because it's for mom, I have no problem paying for it. Very soft, feminine, clean...I hope this becomes her new signature scent. If not, it may become mine. Love it!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,This is my go to scent! I love the earthy smell with hints of chocolate.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,I love the scent of Angel and have for years now. I purchased this size so that my fav could be portable. The only thing I wish is that it was either in a roller ball form or refillable :),4,Sephora,us
Angel,"I have been wearing Angel by Thierry Mugler for a couple of years now. This perfume has become my signature scent. I wear it every day and I LOVE IT!!

Every time I wear this perfume someone always stops me to ask what fragrance I am wearing. Men as well as women always comment on it!!

I actually had an older gentleman following me in a department store around Christmas 2008. He finally got up the courage to ask if he could ask me a personal question. His question was what perfume I was wearing as he wanted to buy it for his wife for Christmas!!

This is the one fragrance that is mom's and only mom's. My daughters can use any perfumes I own except for my ANGEL!!!

I love it so much that I actually carry a small atomizer in my bag so that I have it wherever I go!!!

The fragrance is sexy and intoxicating as well as angelic in its own way. What an appropo name for it!!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"The signature star bottle for Angel was always difficult to keep standing on my dresser. Invariably it always fell over so it would wind up lying down. I always loved the look of the star. Finally, a holder for the bottle!! Love it!!!!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"Love, love, love this perfume! I am so picky when it comes to fragrance. I have to say, I have NEVER smelled anything else like Angel. You will receive TONS of compliments. People stop me everywhere I go to ask what fragrance I am wearing. Not only do I love the unique smell but I also enjoy how it lasts ALL day! Just a few sprays and I can go the whole day and still smell it in the evening! Well worth the money you will spend. The bottle will last you forever!!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,I've always enjoyed this scent and had the opportunity to purchase a bottle in the Sephora Store in Bridgewater Commons Mall . I ran out and was glad they carried Angel.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"Sprayed a sample on myself and couldn't stop smelling my wrist... so much so I ordered it for myself. My husband's reaction was mmm...you smell good, what is that? Haven't stopped wearing it since. One of those fragrances you never tire of!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"This is one of my all time fave scents. I always try new scents but when I need to fall back on a never fail scent, this is one of the scents I can count on to always to make me feel sexy!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I absolutly love this, and so does allot of friends and coworkers. It is amazing!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I'm usually sensitive to perfume smells, but this is different. I adore the smell! Since the scent is unique it seems different to me when I first put it on, then ten minutes later. Actually, I'm not as fond of the first few minutes, but later, when you get deeper into the smells and the perfume reacts to your body chemistry, that's when it is amazing. My husband and daughter both love it as well.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I love it :) i think this perfume is very good
I've been use for years",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I bought this perfume a while ago and was totally enchanted by it when I bought it. I still like it, but I've found that girls tend to like it more than men. This is a captivating scent that's STRONG and contains a UNIQUE, ORIENTAL scent like no other like it. The small bottle is cuter than the larger one, but it should be kept in mind how LITTLE the small refill bottle is in proportion to cost.

A regular ""small bottle of perfume"" is typically 50ml (1.4 fl oz.) and costs about $45, $50

Angel is even smaller at 25 ml and costs about $90 . . .

Definitely invest in large refill bottles if this is YOUR SCENT",3,Sephora,us
Angel,Angel has been my favorite perfume for years and I have been traveling for the last month so I needed a smaller bottle that I could travel with. I purchased a roller type spray and not only does it smell great -it is convienient to carry and it has really lasted!,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"Pine trees, cocoa powder, burnt sugar, and ?decaying dirt? There is something MUSTY (not musky) in here that I cannot tolerate. On the dry down it started to smell like dead people. I sprayed it on a card from the store and my blanket (big mistake) and got the same unsettling odor, so it wasn't just my body chemistry. I'm sad because I adore chocolate and wanted to smell like it all day. I also love the pine, but couldn't get past the dead people scent.",2,Sephora,us
Angel,"I am a retail store manager, and my employees have made great compliments on how good this perfume smells. I am addicted. I liked cleopatra by Tocca, but love Angel as well for a nice change. The customer service was amazing. I wish there were customer comment cards for me to express how I loved my sales person at the Bellevue Square mall in WASHINGTON. I always go on my birthday around beginning of April, she was fantastic.",4,Sephora,us
Angel,Love this perfume! The scent lightly changes throughout the day and lasted thru a 12 hour shift!,5,Sephora,us
Angel,This is the most amazing smelling perfume ever!,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I really enjoy it as much as people around me, last for hours and hours. It is very sexy. I LOVE IT! ! ! ! ! !",5,Sephora,us
Angel,this fragrance is amazing and sophisticated. Love it! A little lasts ALL day long and I get compliments like crazy.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"""LOVE LOVE LOVE"" this perfum! So unique, and I get tons of compliments when I wear it. Great staying power, not overpowering. Just a great woodsy oriental scent.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I love this perfume. I can smell it all day and it makes me smile. I don't know why as I've never been able to find a smell I really like but I have in this perfume, I'll continue to buy.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,This sensual concoction smells clean and makes me feel free...let your hair down for the evening and strut your stuff on the catwalk. The night is yours and the party doesn't start til you walk through in this sensational scent.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I have loved this scent since I first sniff. One spritz is enough, so don't overdo it. This scent can easily become over-powering. Reminds you of something delicious baking in the oven mixed with the spice and mystique of patchouli (think sophisticated patchouli, not stinky B.O. mixed with patchouli) I always buy this for my mother, she loves it and gets many compliments!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I have purchased many perfumes trying to find one that will work with my chemistry and stay all day and I finally found it. I get so many compliments and I simply love the way it smells. My husband also loves the way I smell when I wear this perfume, an added plus! I also like that you can refill the bottle. I am going to try the hair mist next.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"Delicious, I use since I had tried for the first time. The bottle is beautiful, and the fragrance, fresh, sweet and unfforgetable. One of my favorites.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,This smell is great with my chemistry. I tried it in the store once and was hooked. YOu can even purchase refills for the larger sizes. When I travel I love the way it makes me smell and people tend to notice and comment on my purfume.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I love fragrances and have used many different ones but this is by far my most favorite scent!!! It smells slightly different on everyone but the signature notes remain the same on most! The scent stays with you throughout the day!! I get tons of compliments on this all the time!!! Love that you can refill this too!!! Wonderful, warm, sometimes cinnamon like scent!!! A classic, must have!!!!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"i first smelled this on a friend and HATED it. it smelled way too strong and old lady-ish. but one day, while shopping at Saks, i randomly decided to spray a little on my wrist. i was sort of pleasantly surprised, but not in love. well. about 20 minutes later, while on my way home, i started to smell something AMAZING. i thought maybe it was something in my car or one of my bags, but the incredible smell stayed with me all day. i ran back to the saks store, and yep, it was angel! it reacted perfectly with my body's chemistry and smelled TOTALLY different on me than on my friend. anyways, this is my new favorite scent. it's incredibly sexy and delicious smelling---i get compliments everywhere i go!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,This holder is just the ting for the gorgeous Angle star bottle. There is nothing else like it out there!,5,Sephora,us
Angel,I love this scent. I always get compliments. This bottle is a little small for the price but it is great for traveling instead of taking the whole bottle. I wish it was refillable too.,4,Sephora,us
Angel,"This is my favorite perfume! So glad to find a purse size, so I can take with me where ever I go. If you have never worn this scent, give it a try.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,I love the strong sent it lasts all day. My husband smells it sometimes in the house when I am at work and calls me.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"This has always been a favorite of mine for at least the past 10 yrs. It's scrumptious. Once it settles into the skin, the fragrance becomes an intoxicating secret weapon.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I purchased the Angel 0.33 oz Refillable Shooting Star Eau de Parfum Spray last week from Sephora based on the reviews I read here at Sephora. Just a background of what I normally like, I have worn Donna Karan Cashmere Mist and Donna Karan Black Cashmere (discontinued) and sometimes Aqualina Pink Sugar. I usually like woody scents (sandalwood, patchouly, amber) and also food scents like Vanilla, Chocolate or Honey type of scents. Well, I was unsure about this scent as I thought it may be too pungent or sweet (which usually gives me headaches). This scent is so nice, what I smell when it is on is Honey. I don't really smell patchouly or chocolate or any of the other scents everyone has stated.

My husband liked the scent on me so much, that I went out today to the mall and purchased the Hand cream and Body Lotion, and hopefully will get the Shower Gel in the near future! I am so addicted to this scent. I can't stop smelling my wrists. I like the small refillable star bottle I purchased fits perfectly in my handbag, as well as the tube of hand cream. I don't know how long this fragrance has been around, since I only just found it, but I am so glad that I have my new fragrance (that is not discontinued for once). Happy Happy Happy!

Sephora, when are you going to carry the Angel Shower Gel?",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"Most of the attention I get is from the guys, mostly all posative, I absolutely love it, been wearing it for at least 10 years, got alot of milage out of this scent, pricey but well worth it!!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"To me there is no other fragrance in the world like Angel. It is the most delicious smell ever. I have worn it for years and has become my signiture fragrance. When I walk into a room everyone says ""I smell an Angel!""",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"Love, love, love it! I wish all my favorite fragrances were available in this perfect size for purse and/or travel.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,I still have my original refillable bottle of angel! I love that it now comes in a travel size. You either love this scent or hate it but I get so many compliments on it and I personally love it.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,the sent stays on for the WHOLE day. whether its the body lotion or the spray...it just stays! love it!!,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"This stuff rocks!!! I have been wearing it for three years and get compliments all the time. It is sophisticated and classy. And a tiny bit really does go a long way, and lasts all day long!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I wasn't impressed -- I know that's not the popular view of this fragrance, and I really wanted to love it...but I just didn't. It has a sort of dull dry down that smells heavy -- no spice, no sweetness, nothing to punch it up. Perhaps it's just my chemistry -- yes, I think I'll chalk it up to that. It's so famous, it must be me. Maybe you should try before you buy!",1,Sephora,us
Angel,I wanted to like it but it's not working out for me. At first application is nice but then after 5 minutes I fell like I smell like moth balls. Maybe its my DNA. -:) but I have to return this one. I have Alien and it stays my favorite!,3,Sephora,us
Angel,I absolutely love this scent. Every perfume will smell different on everyone but I feel for some reason this works perfectly with my body chemistry. Whenever I wear it I can really smell the chocolate and patchouli. Unfortunately I accidentally bought the refill bottle but it is still beautiful and you actually get alot more.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I am 28 years old and at first I wasn't sure about this scent my friend had worn it a few times and I thought well I kind of like it.Well I went in Sephora and sprayed ONE SQUIRT and went home .My husband came in the room and was sniffing around for alittle while before I asked what are you doing and he said I smell something amazing.Well I had forgotten I had sprayed this 4 hours earlier.We could not figure out the smell and finally he leans in to kiss me and he said babe thats you.Then I had remembered I had sprayed ONE SQUIRT of Angel 4 hours ago.He said that is the best smell ever.He made me go right then to the mall again and buy it.He loves it and I get compliments from men and women all the time.(Just remember when you first spray it,it smells really strong and diffrent let it set for a few minutes and then its perfect.)

Ladies I know it is a little pricey for some people,but I promise it really ends up being the same in the end because you don't have to use as much and it lasts forever.(He could still smell that ONE SQUIRT when we woke up the next morning.)

I really didn't want to give away my secret becasue I don't want all the women in the world to smell GREAT.But I wanted to give other ladies the chance to be ravaged by the man they love.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,A signature scent you will be remembered for....the body lotion is wonderful too! Super value as only a small application is required for the entire day.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"My mother has used Angel for as long as I can remember, and she has always tried to get me to use it. The ingredients and descriptions sound amazing and delicious, but there's one problem: PATCHOULI. A little patchouli goes a very long way, and this perfume has too much of it. I've had headaches for years because of this stuff.",2,Sephora,us
Angel,"I've been a fan of this perfume for as long as I can remember, I haven't had a chance to purchase yet because of the price but I will as soon as I can! It smells really sweet but not like candy, it's a really nice scent.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I really wasn't sure if I liked this perfume or not, but after awhile I couldn't get enough of the smell. My husband loves it , and I get many compliments. It goes on strong but later softens and it lasts all day.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,One of the BEST new scents in a long time!!!!,5,Sephora,us
Angel,ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS!!!!!!! Haven't had too many people say anything but I love it and that's all that matters.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,I've been wearing this scent for years and get at least 3 compliments a week from strangers. No joke. People love it. It stays on forever and I'll keep buying it as long as they keep making it.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,This is the best smelling perfume..it's kinda spicy with a sweet scent to it...I love it!!! Little pricy but worth it!,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"This scent is very distinctive. Heavy, but good for winter. Smells different a half hour after you put it on.",4,Sephora,us
Angel,"I used to wear Angel in the 90s, it was this uber-feminine scent all the way through, from topnotes to drydown but this current version has definitely suffered absurd IFRA anti-allergens restrictions on perfumery via reformulation (less naturals more synthetics substitutes) - the result is rather similar on top but the drydown is very masculine, horrible!",2,Sephora,us
Angel,I have worn this scent since I was a freshman and highschool and can't seem to stray from it. I LOVE the way it smells. Everytime I wear it someone will compliment me... It is the best.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,the packaging is gorgeous but the cream itself is a little too lightweight to pay $85 for. the scent doesn't seem to last as long as it does with the lotion.,3,Sephora,us
Angel,Everyday I wear my perfume I am told I smell good. Everyone will ask what are you wearing?,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I bought a bottle of this for my fave aunt for X-mas and considered buying one for myself. It's sexy, long-lasting and a wonderful scent.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I love perfume. I have many bottles - but this has been my favorite since I first smelled it almost 10 years ago. I received my most recent bottle of Angel for Christmas (purchase from Sephora) and it did not disappoint. I have had several perfumes that the scent changes, becomes weaker with each bottle purchased. I have never had this problem with Angel. I always get so many compliments when I wear it, not to mention it has a very suductive scent, that makes me feel ultimately feminine! For someone who does not like fruity or very foral scents this is perfect!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"great perfume, love the smell but a little musky,",4,Sephora,us
Angel,"I love the lotion, it is soft and pretty. I get many compliments.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"This perfume is so amazing. It goes on strong for about 5 minutes. Then its smell changes so drastically, and it lasts ALLLLL day. I found myself constantly wondering what that pretty smell was when I realized it was me. LOVE LOVE LOVE it.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"If you have not tried this perfume, you need to. If you like a bit of spice, this is the scent for you! I've gotten so many compliments since I started wearing it!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"My mom got me hooked on this, its her ""signature scent"" i think that it smells like chocolate. it last all day and all you need is one spray. i love it and get compliments all the time when im wearing it",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"After working all day, no need to reapply before an evening meeting, or dinner. Last from morning until your nighttime shower. Also love this scent and receive many compliments when I wear it...even on elevators from strangers.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"Really made me smirk, grimace, and dash for running water. Just awful, smells like greasy garage or something.. I don't understand why a woman would want to smell like this.",1,Sephora,us
Angel,"I love this perfume. My Aunt had given me a sample size so I tried it out and was hooked. I agree some scents are not for some people and it depends on your personal chemistry but this one agreed with me. I love the clean light spicey scent. I put it on and honestly the next morning I can smell it on my skin (lightly), it doesn't take much, one or two sprays. I was wearing Cashmere Mist and needed a change, so happy with this.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"This is a strong, noxious smelling perfume. I have smelled plenty of perfumes and buy several of them each year, but this is definitely a scent you either love or hate. I fall into the latter category.",1,Sephora,us
Angel,"I got this as a sample and i'm glad it was only a sample. I put it on and immediately didn't like it, I thought maybe i'd give it time and it will wear off and smell decent, but that didn't happen. I gave the rest of the sample to my mom.",1,Sephora,us
Angel,Angel like. the best stuff I smelt in a long time. It smells of class and yet it is very light smelling. I have had men ask me what I was wear so they could buy it for their wives. honest.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"Not a fan, normally i love oriental perfumes but I honestly can't stand the smell of Angel. Either you love it or youhate it.",2,Sephora,us
Angel,Love it...Best Scent of All...Constant Compliments....Lingers all day long,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"Whenever I wear this fragrance, people stop me and ask me what I'm wearing. When I'm at work, the little ones hug me and tell me how good I smell.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"It took me years to find my signature fragrance but once I found this about six years ago, I've never been able to beat it! I've been lucky enough to have had access to just about every fragrance on the market and believe me, I tried just about all of them. This one though is unforgettable to all who come in contact with it.....and unforgettable in a good way LOL!!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"Everyday I wear this, at least one man and woman ask me what I am wearing. I have had many men ask who is wearing Angel-God you smell good! Warning though- it smells different on everyone-wildly different. My mother LOVES it on me but hates it on her (smells way too sweet on her). Someone else said she only smelled an earthy flower smell on herself, but loved it on me...so try it on and see what your chemistry does to it first.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"Amazing. I don't feel like I can write a review that will do this fragrance justice, but I'll try. In the bottle, this is a very foody, almost savory sort of scent to me, I can't quite place it. When I first apply it all I can smell is clove, it's dead-on clove oil, just like the kind you use for a toothache. It's not terribly unpleasant, but a little bizarre. On drydown....wow. My mind was blown. This is a sweet, smokey, scent that is almost like a gourmand musk. It definitely smells pure and dreamlike, even surreal. This fragrance makes my head spin (in a good way).",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"The one star rating I am required to give is for Thierry Mugler's extremely bold and ambitious creation and for the lasting power of the perfume...regardless of whether you like it or not, this one truly lasts, and lasts and only requires a VERY LIGHT spritz (as in ONE!). So for those that this fragrance works for you, lucky you.

The reviewer that wrote below me that body chemistry is irrelevant. That is not true. To prove my point, s/he states that people need to ""try this on the skin"" first. Bingo! The reason I caution in my reviews, to sample the fragrance not only with the nose but with it sprayed on your skin is because 1) everyone's body chemistry (ie. odor, natural scent, temperature) reacts differently and people's olfactory receptors are unique and different (which is the reason why DOGS can smell more scents and 100x better than human can smell), For instance, a co-worker wears this every. single. night. and it doesn't smell necessarily bad on her, but a whole lot better on her than me!

Now on to the review...this perfume IS true to what it smells like in the bottle for me. Chances are, on first whiff from the bottle you don't like it, you're gonna HATE it on your skin..because it gets worse. This is one that went straight to my head, instantly making me dizzy and literally nauseated. This has got to be THE WORST scent that I have personally smelled

But in true beauty addict form, I troop it out, and continually smell my arm to find any different notes. For the first three hours, I just feel like gagging, kind of like how I gag when I come across something molding and long forgotten in the fridge and now have the duty of scraping into the garbage. The fragrance lightens up after about 4 hours. I cannot personally smell any of the goodness described by others. And I can't even describe what it does smell like because Angel is a melting pot of apparently all things good (chocolate, vanilla, caramel, bergomot, very gourmandy) I guess if I had to describe it, it smells like a molotov cocktail made up of patchouli, gasoline, powder, and a hint of vanilla. Blegh.

Finally, to offer a helpful hand as to what appeases my nose I guess I would consider myself a fan of more fruity and floral scents as well as woodsy scents. I LIKE Viktor and Rolf Flowerbomb, Eau Mega, Anna Pliska, Hanae Mori Blue, Burberry London for Men, any of the Escada summer scents like Ibiza Hippie and Moon Sparkle

I'm NOT a fan of Angel, Pink Sugar (too, too sweet for me) many of the Bond lines. Juicy Couture's Juicky Couture, anything with too much musk, rose, or powder",1,Sephora,us
Angel,I'm glad I only got a sample of this perfume. This is one of the worst smelling perfumes I've ever smelled. I asked the rest of my family how it smelled and they hated it as well.,1,Sephora,us
Angel,"This is the fragrance that started the modern gourmand trend. The patchouli really is prominent and weaves around the dessert notes. I like that it never seems too hippy dippy, like patchouli can easily be. Angel smells warm and icy at the same time.
It is important to try this on the skin, but forget about the ""different body chemistry"" thing that everybody talks about. You either like a certain fragrance or you don't. Generally speaking, it's more about what you think smells good, rather than body chemistry.
So when you like the way something smells, it's personal preference.
The reason to try a frag on is to see how it will smell after the top notes wear off.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,Brought this recently. Loved it when it first came out years ago and been desperate to buy a bottle more recently but not too sure the boyf would like it as he hates scent to be too strong. Bit the bullet and found that 1-2 spritz is enough to last all day on me but others have to be in fairly close proximity to smell. Seems pricey but cause you dont need too much actually lasts for ages. In short have re-discovered this lovey sumptious girlie scent and loving it!!,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"This scent is absolutely amazing! It's like nothing i ever smelled before. it's soft, clean, powdery, and Beautiful!
I would say this fragrance is for a classy woman who has great style and taste. If you are a fan of lancome's hypnose or guerlain Insolence than i believe you will love this just as much! I am going to buy a bottle of this for christmas as i think it's the perfect scent for a winter wonderland. Give this a try!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,I love this fragrance and am on my second bottle. It has great staying power unlike many others I've tried and passed on.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I was looking for a new scent. A girlfriend of mine wears Angel & I love how it smells on her. So 1st I went to my local Sephora store to pick up a sample to try for a couple of days - kudos to Sephora for providing such a fantastic service, by the way. At first it has a sweet chocolate smell & ends with an earthy, citrus scent - I love it! The only reason I didn't give Angel 5 stars, is because I have to use quite a bit, 5 - 7 spritzes, to make it strong enough for my liking & it doesn't last all day. But like a previous reviewer states; everyone has differing body chemistry. It may be stronger & longer lasting on another.",4,Sephora,us
Angel,"I was reading all of the reviews on here and there is something that you all need to remember. We all have a different chemical makeup, chemistry, pheromones. If you are going to buy a new perfume TRY IT on! Things that smell good on some people stink on others. My mom loved the smell of this perfume on me, so she tried it and it smelt awful on her.

Personally I love this perfume. I started wearing it was I was in high school (1997) and wore it for years. It was my signature sent and on me it smells like cotton candy. The bergamot and vanilla really come through with my chemistry while I know others where the caramel, patchouli and chocolate are the lingering scents. It’s a very romantic with oriental notes.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"IF you are looking for a fragrance that lasts all day this is it!

You only need 1 or 2 sprays for the whole day, if you spray anymore of course you'll get a headache... DUH!
this is a really wonderful and kinda 'romantic' perfume. IT smells so sweet but its a classy, seductive sweet..
I have received so many compliments from men about this perfume and a few from ladies!

This perfume is a show stopper, if you don't wanna be noticed DON'T WEAR IT!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I am someone who perfers the spice, Asian type fragance. It is strong and last a long time - both things I do look for when buying. However the frangance is strong but not cheap. I realize this is not a perfume that everyone can wear. When I was purchasing this the clerk said she would love to be able to wear Angel but can't - it does not work on her body. I think it will work for you or it will not - no inbetween. I have also had friends that have used this perfume and it smelled so different on them then it does on me. Also - get a sample and wear it for a few hours - it changes with your own body chemistry, therefore it will not sell the same late as it did when you put it on. Bottom line - if you like a non-flowery/ spicy perfume - that lasts - this is the one for you.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"Every time I wear this scent, I get compliments from men and women.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"This is such a love it or hate it fragrance. I'm in the love it camp. :) I'll tell you, this thing smells SO different on a body than in the bottle. In the bottle is concentrated, harsh, and while intriguing, kind of standoffish. But when you put it on, it's like a sweet chocolaty/berry wonderland. One spritz is ALL it takes, just one! I maintain it's the women who practically bathe in it that give it such a bad name.
NOTE: IF IT COSTS $$$$$$$, DON'T USE IT LIKE YOU GOT IT AT THE DOLLAR STORE. THERE IS A REASON FOR THIS.
But now, on to the scent. The chocolate stays the entire time, from first spritz to disappearance, but it becomes slightly less sweet as time goes on. At first you smell sweet something, soft of like fruity candy filling and musk. And then, you realize it's chocolate, like a cherry truffle (though it doesn't really smell like ""cherry"" if you get what I mean) and this whole time, you've been smelling by sexy, soft, luxurious chocolate that leaves you wanting to turn around and sniff behind you to get a whiff of the flavor.
Overall, I absolutely love this fragrance, and I hope to God that other people love it on me too, because this is my signature. The ONLY reason I took off one lippie is price v. staying power. I know my skin dulls fragrances, but for the amount per ml (about $1.90 a ml, based on $95 for 50ml), I'd really hope that a scent this notoriously strong would last all day. Alas, it's not meant to be. So one star off for that. Otherwise, I highly recommend it. :)",4,Sephora,us
Angel,I don't really understand how anybody could like this. Thank goodness I'm just wearing a sample of this horrible scent. You couldn't pay me to wear this. All I can smell is a very deep bitter old auto mechanic shop smell. Not the chocolate smell I hoped for.,1,Sephora,us
Angel,"Just tried a sample of Thierry Mugler’s _Angel_ that came in the mail with my previous Sephora order. Mostly because I thought it’d be amusing — if it was any good — to have a bottle of perfume on my dresser that had my name (well, I’d have to Sharpie in an additional letter, but nothing’s perfect) on it.

Unfortunately, I went reeling backward after one small spritz on the arm and then bolted to the sink to scrub it off with liberal dollops of strongly-scented antibacterial soap, endeavoring to erase the olfactory menace burning itself into my skin. Remember those five-year-old Christmas candles that you see in bulk clearance at Big Lots, a dozen tapers for $1? Yeah, that’s about what this stuff reminded me of.

It’s calling itself an “oriental gourmand” scent, which I guess explains the patchouli (and confused me as to whether it was actually a mens’ cologne on first sniff). Other than that, I can’t really classify anything else in the ingredients as distinctly “oriental” — at least in the sense that I’d find a representation in my parents’ kitchen. Oh, confusion. The list of participants includes chemical-created aromas helional and hedione (contributing to the cloying nature, I’m sure), western baking favorites such as vanilla, chocolate and caramel and smatterings of “honey, dewberry and red berries” that were far too overpowered by the other ingredients to even be recognizable. I’m guessing this one’s meant strictly to attract dudes, in that way where it’s strong enough for them to notice and makes them hungry enough to consider whether or not you’d be a candidate to bake for them over the holidays. Then again, you’d get the same sort of scent combination on a visit to grandma’s place, and I’m not sure I’d want any date-potential candidate calling memories of that place “sensual and passionate”…

Anyway, I ended up spraying the rest of it in the storage room, figuring it’d at least be good at scaring off moths. I’m nothing if not an optimist.",1,Sephora,us
Angel,This is the best smelling perfume ever made. I absolutely LOVE it! Whenever I wear it I am complimented all day on how wonderful I smell. I only wish it were less expensive so I could make it the only cologne/perfume I wear.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"OMG the best scent ever. I've been looking for the perfect fragrance that's not too sweet and not too floral; this is it. Angel smells mouthwateringly delicious with its blend of chocolate, caramel, and musky tones. It's a mature scent that's very strong and lasting.
I'm not easily impressed by scents, especially the sweet ones, but the unique blend from Angel is so different from anything I've ever smelled before that I am in LOVE with it.
If you're on the fence about Angel, I'd suggest you get it (tons of people have complimented).",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I was really excited to try this perfume, but I found it to be VERY strong and overpowering. Just one whiff almost makes me sick. I found it to be very old smelling, and on me it almost has a strong chemical smell like bathroom cleaner-not appetizing at all! I had high hopes for this one, but it is awful!",1,Sephora,us
Angel,"I got a free sample of this when I ordered somoething from Sephora, and the scent is absolutley horrific! It is so old, it also has a srong perfumey gross smell. The only good feature is does have is staying power, It wouldn't fade off!",2,Sephora,us
Angel,"It lacks the consistency to be an all-year body moisturizer. Also, it does not hold scent as well as other brands. I recommend the cream instead.",2,Sephora,us
Angel,I used to love this perfume when I was in college...now it gives me a headache,3,Sephora,us
Angel,"This is now one of my favorite perfumes. It is by far one of the most unique, beautiful scents and I have received dozens of compliments since I started wearing it. It has such a pure, feminine note and lasts all throughout the day. The bottle it comes in is gorgeous, too. I've worn this to the office as well as out on the weekends, and it's great that this is ideal for both. I will definitely be buying another bottle when I run out.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"This smells delicious! On me, it smells a lot like Prada, just a touch more oriental. It last all day, and I love going into my bedroom after I've sprayed it and the scent is still lingering. It is kind of a heavy scent, and I prefer to wear it at night.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"AT first when I sprayed it on, it overpowered me..yet as the day wore on the scent changed and became clean and fresh and sexy...and a week later i still smell it on my jacket...works well with my chemistry..probably not for everyone as it starts out heavy but ends up fabulous",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I wasn't sure how I'd like this fragrance. I seem to remember not liking it when it first came out, which puzzled me, b/c it seemed like EVERYONE loved it. So, I gave it another try recently. It smells better on me than it did on a tester.

I was worried about the presence of patchouli, b/c my husband hates that smell, but interestingly enough, he hasn't complained, so it must not be that strong.

I usually wear florals with citrus notes. But, I haven't found any that lasts all day slong without reapplying or layering. I have to say that, on me, this fragrance lasts all day and I don't need to bathe in it either. A few sprays is enough.

I tend to switch fragrances with the seasons. This one seems suited to fall/winter. I like something lighter for warmer weather.",4,Sephora,us
Angel,Wonderful fresh scent.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"Absolutely love it; wish I could drown it. It's sexy yet not overpowering. Sweet but not sickening-sweet. A hint of musk. A hint of floral. Very unique. I can't wear anything else anymore. A definite ""must-have"".",5,Sephora,us
Angel,This is a great scent that gets plenty of compliments. Not too heavy perfect for work or going out. I find that the lotion lasts all day but the spray wears out too quickly.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I always get a positive reaction when I wear this, from people recognizing the scent to those asking me what I'm wearing. It's light, feminine, a bit powdery, a bit musky with vanilla overtones.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,I love it. Stays all day. Smells better when you are in a room full of men.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,I was looking for a refill for my Angel bottle and they thought they were out and it was on backorder but they checked in the back and had one!!! Yeah ME!,4,Sephora,us
Angel,"I love this perfume. I don't like it when i smell it directly from the bottle, or as soon as i spray it on my wrist. I love it after it dries. The scent is captivating. It is such a warm but fresh smell. I usually like fragrances that i would classify as 'darker' frangrances such as CK Euphoria and Dior Midnight Poison. Angel seems completely different, but it is so intoxicating to me. I put a little on my wrist, and i keep getting wiffs of it throughtout the day. This frangrance definitely lasts all day. i love it!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I really like Angel. It is *not* a scent for everyone. It's got a thickness to it, and it lingers all day. It is a sensual, deep, and alluring fragrance, not light and girly. It is not flowery, it is sexy in a dark way.

The hubbers liked this one. He said ""Woo! SPICEY! I like it."" which is a pretty big reaction for him.",4,Sephora,us
Angel,"Years ago I used a sample and it seemed that a good number of men responded to this perfume; I have received numerous compliments. It is a little strong at times... it'll give me a headache some days and my hubby (who doesn't like most perfumes) isn't thrilled about it. I still wear it because I enjoy the response it gets.

Most perfumes/deodorants I try do not smell good on my skin at all! It is quite difficult to find something even palatable so I'm quite happy that this perfume has turned heads. When I need a break, I go to Hanae Mori (truly amazing).... Sarah Jessica Parker's Lovely smells nice, light, and clean on my skin as well.

Perhaps if your skin is hard to scent, you could sample this and see if it wins for you too!",4,Sephora,us
Angel,"I used to work as a concierge at a high-rise condo by the beach and every night the ladies would come down for a night on the town. One woman always smelled amazing and after several nights of begging, I finally convinced her to reveal that her signature scent was Angel. To me the fragrance has a richness like butter with caramel and a little spice.
I only denied it a star because after a few months of use, it suddenly was too strong for me and started giving me little sneezing fits if I used too much.",4,Sephora,us
Angel,This perfume is simply beautiful.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,This is the most beautiful scent i've ever worn. i've been wearing it for slightly over a year now and have no plans to change..,5,Sephora,us
Angel,This is and always will be my #1 scent........I love that the perfume spray and the Eau De Star both come in refillable bottles. Saves soo much money too!,5,Sephora,us
Angel,this scent has been my scent for as long as i can remember...it's the best one for me:),5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I love this perfume so much for night, and it's chocolate-y smell is so great! I like it for going out to dinner or a movie with friends.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"was excited about getting this perfume because
of the chocolate notes but fail short of my expectations",1,Sephora,us
Angel,"I personally love this scent, but some people that I know really hate it. This must be the most controversial bottle of perfume that I own! I find it to be warm, sensual, deep and alluring, but some people are really repulsed by it, and that kind of bothers me. It is rather strong too, so there's really no down-playing this scent. For my love and attraction to this scent I give it 5 stars but for the negative reaction of many others to it I must detract one star. Angel is a 4 star perfume in my book!",4,Sephora,us
Angel,I was given this perfume in 2007 because the person didn't like it! I am so grateful for this discovery! Angel is wonderful! I had to purchase the body creme to accomodate it. I am hooked! It's expensive but worth every penny! It lasts and lasts and lasts! I had to buy another bottle of perfume. I do not allow any family member to use my perfume!,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"Angel has been my signature fragrance for years. My husband does not typically like fragrances, but does enjoy this one and many people (even strangers) have stopped to ask me what I am wearing.",4,Sephora,us
Angel,"This perfume is wonderful and so very sexy. My boyfriend completely loves this scent on me, is great!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,i think Angel is unique and exotic. Once you wear this scent it's hard to use any other one. It keeps you coming back.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,Is was a gift My mother loves it,4,Sephora,us
Angel,"SO DISAPPOINTED
Sephora was great but Theirry Mugler unknowingly and unannounced changed the formula of the Angel Body Cream. Having been a fan for years, when the much anticipated product arrived I was devastated. The scent no longer even resembles Angel perfume or the prior body cream. Sephora was true to their reputation and their customer service was fabulous.",1,Sephora,us
Angel,"I love this fragrance, you have wait a few minutes before the true smell develops. But it's worth the wait! I've also had many compliments on my perfume. I'm in love!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,its such a feminine sexy smell everytime i wear it i get compliments all day long.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"This is my favorite of all time. I started wearing this perfume 8 years ago and I still love it. It has a very unique smell, soft but very lasting (all day). You can smell the chocolate infused with the floweres. I will keep buying this until they stop manufacturing this product!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I cannot say enough about how wonderful this fragrance is--the bottle itself is beautiful and refillable!! The fragrance itself is absolutely the most complex, sexy and sensual fragrance I ever smelled--and it just makes you feel GOOD! This lasts allll day and people will comment on how great you smell-
costly but well worth it :)
Good treat for yourself!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I JUST READ SOME OF THE REVEIWS ANGEL GOT FROM SOME PEOPLE AND I CAN'T BELIEVE WHAT THEY WROTE, THAT IT IS NOT LASTING, IT LAST ALL DAY ON ME, AND I HAVE NEVER GOTTEN SO MENY COMPLEMENTS ON ANY OTHER SCENT THAT I HAVE WORN BEFORE. I LOVE ANGEL AND WOULD NOT WARE ANY THING ELSE.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I love this fragrance, and then sometimes it gets to me. Yes, it is sweet and has warm dark chocolate, honey, and dewberry notes blended with the patchouli. This is a dreamy combination and a very high quality fragrance, as it lasts a long time when you spray it on. Do not spray too much, just a spritz on the neck area, and then on a wrist is plenty. Otherwise, you'll ruin the mystery of Angel. It might not mix well with everyone's body chemistry because there are a lot of mixed opinions about it. I highly recommend getting a sample FIRST, use it for a bit, and then decide if it is right for you. Me personally, I don't like floral fragrances, so this was perfect for me.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,i've never received so many compliments --- even from strangers! it's just lovely.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,i love this perfume it just makes me happy,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I have tried other perfumes but I keep coming back to ""Angel""! I love it!!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,I didn't like this product. I returned it to the store after I purchased it. This was actually my fault. I did not know it was hair mist when I first purchased it. Sephora gives you the opportunity to try everything out so I should have known better.,2,Sephora,us
Angel,"I was excited to try this perfume because the reviews were so positive. I found this to be really terrible, I can't think of another perfume that has ever smelled any worse than this. I agree with the reviewers that say this is unique, but not in a positive sense. It sounds great with the chocolate and various extracts, but this is one you should personally sample. This is not a purchase that should be made based only on reviews in my opinion. This fragrance has a very specific appeal and will not be pleasing to those who tend to prefer a floral, light floral, citrus, or light oriental scent.",1,Sephora,us
Angel,"I own many fragrances, but nothing on earth compares to the heavenly smell of Angel by Thierry Mugler. Every time I wear it, I receive many compliments from both men and women. It has the amazing ability to lift my spirits as soon as I spritz some of the Angel perfume on. My hubby just bought me the largest bottle available. I'm definitely overjoyed!!!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,This would top the list. I love the complexity of this fragrance. I wear it more than any other scent. One spritz is all that I need.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,This product is for those who like others to smell you. Its a little dark and sexy smelling. At first it smells a little strong but in 10 min it smells sooo sweet!,5,Sephora,us
Angel,I bought this scent cause of all the great reviews and when I tried it I loved the smell of it on me BUT it doesn't last. I can't even smell it on me 10 mins later so I'm returning it. I never had a scent dissapear so fast on me as this one. Too bad cause I really liked this one.,4,Sephora,us
Angel,"I have been wearing this perfume since 1992 and it has not failed me yet. If you like deep, dark sexy scents this is for you. Practically edible.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I've worn this since the year it came out and wouldn't be without it... everyone, and I mean everyone comments when they get close enough ......mmmmmmm, you smell good! The custodian at school got a bottle from me at Christmas one year after she told me she loved how the chair in my office had the faint scent on it...",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I like this fragrance because it is unique. When I first bought it, it was a little overwhelming and I didn't really like the initial scent, but after I put it on, I liked the way it mixed with my body chemistry. I got a flattering comment on it the first day I wore it. I don't like to wear it in the summer, because of the heat and humidity I live in, the scent can be way too overpowering for other people. So, I wear something a little fresher during the day in the summer. All in all, this is the perfume I reach for first and I have tried many. I always remember my mom wearing Opium and how it was a part of her and I feel like that about Angel.",4,Sephora,us
Angel,"Ugh! Licorice root chocolate cigar. That is what you smell like with this perfume on. Very overpowering, not understated sexy at all...plegghh!",1,Sephora,us
Angel,"this is a classic for me. It's so unique, no matter where i go eveyone notices me.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I think this scent came from Heaven and all the Angels wear it. I love it. Its one of my ALL Time Favorites and if I could afford it I would only wear it all the time, but for now I just wear it when I go out to dinner or somewhere spiecial with family and friends. It lasts for hours the heavenly scent isnt over powering it reminds me of cotton candy.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I bought this years ago in Chicago.. it has become my ""staple"" and the compliments have never ceased.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,I absolutly love this fragrance!!!!,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I received Angel as a present. It is fantastic, just like a dream.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,This is a great fragrance for those who need to just feel a bit sexy.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I always think something was worth the money when I get compliments from other people. With Angel perfume I get constant compliments - even from complete strangers in the airport, at the mall - its great! makes me feel good - at least I know the smell is pleasing to others.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"Angel is my favorite fragrance. I have worn it for years. It is completely sexy, stays on very well...I can smell it hours later on my clothes, but it is not strong or overwhelming. I wear it everyday and get tons of compliments.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"i started wearing this fragrance over 18 years ago when i lived in Europe. At the tme we did not have it state side so i would have to bring it home, This is the nicest easiet to wear because it lasts all day and is not over powering. My absolute FAVORITE!!!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I first tried this becuase I heard my boyfriend raving about it, but after having it on me for 3 hours, I failed to see what was so special about the scent. I'm sure that the making of the perfume is quite special since no floral extracts are used, but all it reminds me of is food. I don't want to eat my perfume. Otherwise, it's very well made, and creative, but not for the ones who love the sensitivity of flowers.",4,Sephora,us
Angel,"I was looking for something a little different, and this is it! It's warm, sexy, sultry...I just feel good wearing it. I think it's too mature for a younger girl, but it's not an old lady scent by any means. Not too foody or too flowery. Good for nights out or when you just want to feel sexy.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"Angel is a very unique fragrance that is very pleasant and not overwhelming. One thing I really like about it is that it has real staying power. I put it on in the morning and it lasts all day. This fragrance is hard to describe...very unique and feminine. The bottle is beautiful, too. Very nice fragrance.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I bought Angel because of all the good reviews, and I wasn't disappointed. It has a scent that's like no other. One spritz lasts all day. It's delicious!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,I have tried so many perfumes and this one is definitely one of my favorites. It has a very seductive scent and all you need is one spritz. I save this one for special evenings and it last the entire event.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,Very long lasting scent. Like nothing you have ever smelled before...,5,Sephora,us
Angel,A guaranteed show stopper...I haven't met a guy yet that is immune to this fragrance!,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"Well,I'm married now.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,I Love it! This is my all time favorite scent. It is soooo long lasting and so sexy smelling. My hubby loves when I wear it - he can smell it.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I started to wear this product right when it first came out. It is one of my all time favorites, a classic. For me, this fragrance will never be dull. I like to use it when I feel ""pretty, oh so pretty"".",5,Sephora,us
Angel,This scent is perfect. Wear it with anything. Guys love to smell it on me and will in fact seek me out to ask me if that is Angel I'm wearing. A must have!,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"This scent makes me feel elegant and decadent all wrapped up. It's sexy, confident and truly memorable. I find it a little heavy for daytime, but it is a true luxury once the sun sets that I take pleasure in indulging in!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,I Love Angel and all of the Angel perfumes! A heavenly scent mix of baby oil and chocolate makes for a long-lasting smell which you will get complimented on all day long.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"This scent is so rich yet balanced. It is sexy, but also approachable, it is woman in a bottle. This perfume is always a part of my fragrance collection! Everytime I wear it i get so many compliments. The patchouli makes it1",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"i first purchased this fragrance in france, so i'll always associate good things with it. it's warm and sweet, yet sophisticated and sexy. men and women alike love it! i enjoy wearing it for any occasion, but especially for romance ; )",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"After all my perfume using years this STILL gets the most compliments. No need to use a lot, a little goes a LONG way with this one.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,angel is a very seductive scent. Its been my favorite scent for 6 years,5,Sephora,us
Angel,This is my fragrance. I have been using it long before it was easy to find. It's absolutely my top choice. Everyone always compliments the scent and wonders what it is. I look forward to trying the new limited summer edition. This one IS a little heavy throughout the summertime. But just like white shoes after labor day- I still wear it.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"sinfully delicious, chocolaty, intense, concentrated - just a tiny spritz will have you in heaven, angel!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"This perfume is absolutly intoxicating. It has a baby powder-ish scent to it, and also something else that I can't really explain. I love it. When you first spray it on it smells kind of woodsy, but after it sits on your skin for a minute it changes into the best scent ever! And it is also unmistakeable, no other perfume even resembles it. I can always tell anyone who's wearing it. It's gorgeous. Try it!!!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,I've used this fragrance for years and absolutely love it. The great thing about the lotion is that you can just use it in the summer on your upper body and forget the spray perfume all together. The scent is strong enough and last all day.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"after ordering this perfume on ebay and receiveing a fake, i went to the sephoria website and received the perfume that i knew and loved. thanks.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,I have searched high and low for a perfume that would last all day. I assure you that Angel is worth the price. This perfume has a very enchanting smell that you can resist. At first it may smell strong but I promise you will not regret it. The scent stays on all day. I usually spray it on my clothes and stuff because the scent last. I always get compliments and you can smell me from a mile away. If you want a perfume that will last and smells delicious I suggest buying Angel. I have all their goodies. I promise you can't go wrong with this product. I always recommended it to all my friends because they can't get enough of it.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I was at a party over 15 years ago and a young woman had this perfume in her bag. She was having her friends try it because it had ""chocolate"" in it! I thought, ""Anything that has chocolate in it, I've gotta try it!!"" I have the perfume, lotion, spray oil (very nice), shower gel, glitter powder (my FAVE) and powder pearls...you could say I'm somewhat of an addict. I get compliments on this scent all the time. I even had a man buy it for his wife because he liked how it smelled on me! Just lovely, but a little goes a long way, so go easy. Enjoy!!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,Wonderful and allows you to use less perfume and extend the scent! I use it on my elbows and knees and it carries well throughout the day! Love it!!,4,Sephora,us
Angel,"As I cannot find my ""signature fragrance,"" I'm constantly trying new ones. I do love this scent - it's sultry and ""chocolate-y,"" although it doesn't seem to last that long. I typically go for intense perfumes (Cartier Delices, Fracas, Hermes), but also like Hanai Morae Butterfly & Juicy Couture. Hope this helps!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I love the perfume, and I bought the shower gel as a splurge, for it IS pricey.That was the only reason I gave it 4 stars. Don't let your husband use this! Hide it from your daughter. It's too precious to waste on mere mortals. I wish I could put into words how well scented this is, truly unique and modern, but evokes old time sensual tradition as well. Have fun trying to define it!",4,Sephora,us
Angel,"Angely by thierry Mugler is a very, very, nice scent. It is not overpowering and you will receive many compliments especially from the men. The scent is soft and sensual and would be appropriate for anyone at any age. Not an old, harsh scent. I would suggest making a small purchase at first to see how well it works with your body chemistry and decide from there. It is my signature scent.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I originally hated the scent of this perfume, but the more I smelled it the more it grew on me. I now wear it everyday, spraying on my pulse points and on the back of my neck so it sits in my hair...I am consistently receiving compliments from men and women...it smells especially great when I layer it over Bath and Body works sweet cinnamon pumpkin lotion",5,Sephora,us
Angel,I've been looking for a fragrance that REALLY has to work with body chemistry to make it work...basically a perfume that you fall into two categories: love it or hate it. This one fits the bill...I want a perfume that isn't overly popular (because everybody doesn't love it). The only gripe I have is that it's so dang on expensive!!! But I may go for the 0.8 or 0.33 ounce bottles.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"Angel is kind of an acquired taste. I happen to love it. I always say it reminds me of Christmas trees and cotton candy, but in a very sophisticated way! It brings back lots of happy childhood memories for me, and is very comforting for whatever reason. It is a stronger fragrance, and I wouldn't recommend it to someone who doesn't like a bolder scent. But if you're not afraid to take a chance, go for it! (Just don't overdo it; a little goes a long way. Especially in warmer weather.) The bottle is also perfection. Get the little stand to go with it if you can. It makes a lovely display!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I love the smell, specially couple hours after I wear it. everyone asks me what is your perfume.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,This scent is my absolute favorite! My husband LOVES it on me. I've never had so many compliments from both men and women. It's worth every penny.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"this is my absolutely most favorite fragrance...so fresh, light, semi-sweet, semi-musk...i am addicted!!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"This is my favorite fragrance. It is soft, sensual and unmistakable. A fragrance that never gets old. The body creme is heavenly.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,love the smell of this perfume with the body lotion. Very refreshing.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,Angel is awesome on the body- but now in my hair... Yum.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,I like this product because it doesn't contain all the alcohols that normal perfumes can have in them. My boyfriend is always commenting on how good my hair smells! Love to spitz a little in my hats so they don't get that stinky!,4,Sephora,us
Angel,"i was first given angel as a christmas gift from my bf in college. when i smelled it, i remember thinking ""does he hate me??""-- it was awful. but then, something happened...not sure what, but i siddenly kinda liked it and began wearing it mor eoften. no matter what, to this day (7 years later) i get compliments on it. i wear this almost daily and it never fails. boys seem to be hypnotized by it (one boy just yesterday said: ""you're wearing angel arent you? thats not fair..."") and girls are always jealous of how it smells on me as they claim they cant pull it off themselves.

as a side note, i always moisturize head to toe (ok, shoulder to toe) with warm vanilla sugar body cream. vanilla is one of the notes of angel and it seems to be a great mix. people LOVE it on me.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"This is a perfume that you can spot a mile away. It's so fantastic and a special treat. It is strong so only use a bit, but it is a classic for the ages.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"Yummy yummy yummy! Yummy, but grown up and sexy at the same time. Sweet and enchanting smell. Simply the best. This scent is very distinctive, so if you're looking for a signature scent, this might be the one.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"A young woman came into my office for a business meeting, and I had to ask her afterwards, ""What perfume are you wearing?"" The answer came: ""Thierry Mugler's Angel"". I couldn't wait to get home to find out if Sephora was a source! Seductive, evoking comments from others, and my husband LOVES IT!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"But after a little bit, I fall right in love with how it smells on me. I bought it mainly because it was in the same category on here as Lolita Lempicka, and the refillable bottles were so pretty, so I got a .8oz star. I didn't even bother smelling it first.
When I first tried it on, it smelled really strong, and sour. I was starting to regret it but it settled onto my skin with a nice icecreamy smell. One spray stays strong for a long time.
The .8oz star is bigger than I expected, and I kind of want to get a mini one to keep in my purse. I'm sure I'll get a big refill bottle once I'm down to the bottom of this.",4,Sephora,us
Angel,"i have worn this for over 5 years and every single time, someone compliments me on it. lush, rich and chocolate-y and is meant to be used sparingly so it lasts a long time. i'll never stop wearing this!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,Love the size and shape ofthe bottle...The FRAGRANCE is yummy too!,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"Love this scent- I agree- a little does go a long way and it is very true that it smells different on different folks due to chemistry. I would highly recommend trying it for a day be for committing to purchase, Beyond that I love it when my man sends me a message that he still smells my perfume on his pillow! LOL",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"Love, love, love this fragrance and all of the extra formats. I really like the idea of the hair mist. It is not as long lasting as I expected, however.",4,Sephora,us
Angel,"my favorite perfume. been wearing for 10+ years and no plans to stop now!! very distinctive scent, beautiful bottle.... i love it.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"This is my favourite perfume, and I've been using it for years. The scent suits me perfectly, and I've been told that I smell delicious. I love that there are refill bottles available too.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"This isn't my daily scent,

but when I first bought it, I didn't even wanna use it. I would just smell it out of the bottle. I love this scent. Whenever I smell it on someone, I get the impression of sophistication, serious, almost mysterious, fun.

It's costly, but I love it. Alot of people have invested in this scent and continued to use for years. That much says it all. Angel is keeper. :)

Only downside: I haven't received many compliments from men, but online reviews say guys do like Angel.",4,Sephora,us
Angel,"I love the scent of this perfume; sensual, yet innocent and still playful. I got the hair perfume in this, which was okay, but I think it was a waste of money for something that you spray in your hair. The scent did not really last in my hair as well. I would buy this again, but in the perfume bottle!",4,Sephora,us
Angel,"Ugh, This smells so bad almost dirty.I do not understand the cult following this has . It is overpowering and if it gets on your clothes the reek will never come out even after dry cleaning!",1,Sephora,us
Angel,The product description for the 3.4 refill does not indicate it comes with a funnel but it does. I bought the Sephora atomizer for the funnel - it is much better than the funnel which comes with the Angel refill bottles. This is the classic birthday request from my mom - I will continue to order this one.,4,Sephora,us
Angel,"I've worn Angel for at least 5 years and it my absolute all time favorite! It smells a little different on everyone but I've gotten nothing but compliments when I wear it. You do have to be careful not to overspritz though, a little goes a LONG way!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,I got this perfume after reading all of the good reviews it had and i'm not disapointed! It smells sort of chocolately and it's better suited for nightime. It lasts really long too! I put it on in the morning to see how long it would last and I could still smell it at the end of the day!,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"A friend of mine ranted and raved about this stuff (she lives in Chicago, so I had not smelled it). Finally, I found some and tried it on. A few minutes later, I bought the refillable. I do not wear it every day, but when I do, I *always* get compliments. I have refilled it once. Yes, this is a pricey scent, but it also lasts. It has staying power too, so you won't need to refresh it all day.

I've bought the sample size ones to give as gifts to people who have loved it on me. I was even hunting for a fragrance for my wedding, but my fiance told me he loved THIS one on me, and couldn't understand why I'd go for something different.

This is my signature scent.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"ok this scent is NOT really for younger girls...I first tried it when I was 18 and it was waaay too strong. but now that I am older it smells absolutely AMAZING!! i guess your body chemistry changes. Now I get tons of complements, especially from guys. Great scent for women but not for teens.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,I love Thierry Muggler. I receive so many compliments and questions regarding what I'm wearing. I just wish they would bring back Le Rose Angel. Please please please.,4,Sephora,us
Angel,IF YOU ARE AN ANGEL LOVER LIKE I AM THIS IS THE GREATEST WAY TO GET THE TRUE SCENT AND ALSO GIVE YOUR SKIN MOISTURE THAT STAYS!!! THIS JAR LASTS ME SEVERAL MONTHS. I KNOW IT IS PRICY BUT IT IS WORTH IT!! IT IS MY FAVORITE ANGEL PRODUCT,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"Best scent I have ever worn. I get comments or people ask around me who smells so good everywhere I go. in elevators, stores, home, restaurants, and so forth. I have worn this since it came out. Wonderful smell.To those whop don't like it maybe it's your body chemistry. it does affect the scent of what you are wearing. This one is highly commented on by those around me in a very positive way. People always ask what is the perfume or scent I am wearing. Wish it was a little less expensive",5,Sephora,us
Angel,I love this perfume. My husband does too. Anybody want to get rid of theirs. I will buy from you.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,This is my favorite scent. I am so pleased to see that Sephora offers it. It was very convenient.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"Hideous, overwhelming patchouli. Instant headache.",1,Sephora,us
Angel,"This perfume is VERY strong and the smell is overly sweet and nauseating. If you have never smelt this perfume before, I would not rely on the reviews. Go in to a store and smell a sample first. This seems to be one people either love or hate.",1,Sephora,us
Angel,"Everywhere I go when I wear Angel I get the most wonderful compliments, there will be several people in the room and one person will ask ""Who is wearing Angel"" and of course it will be me.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,Always loved this scent and every man I know loves it too!,5,Sephora,us
Angel,this is my all time favorite scent. it's sexy and confident. i've worn it for years and always receive compliments. great design with the refillable bottle. earth friendly. :),5,Sephora,us
Angel,"At first when I smelt this fragrance on my friend, it was almost overwhelming... then she gave it to me for my birthday, and I'm so glad she did. I wouldn't recommend it for wearing during work (might be too overpowering for daytime) but definitely perfect for evening. It smells decadent and delicious!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,I have worn this fragrance for years now and I still love it. Every time I wear it I get TONS of compliments. You can't go wrong with Angel.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I have allergies. I had given up on finding a frangrance that I could wear. I worked with a woman all day and loved her purfume. I asked her what it was and found out it was Angel. Yes, it is strong. Alittle will go a long way, but I am so glad that I found a perfume that does not aggrevate my allergies.",4,Sephora,us
Angel,"I've wanted this perfume for approximately 4 years now.

I absolutely love it, and could not be any happier.

It is strong, so a single spray post-shower is usually all it takes...and it sticks with me all day.

The other day after the gym, I let my ponytail down and was still delighted by it's lasting presence!

Amazing scent that is distinctly different...although I could see why the oils might not play as well with others.

Some skin/oil types are just better suited for a different scent palette...but for mine it doesn't get any better than this!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"This is not a teen scent. No fresh fruits here or that same smell you've spritzed from 100 different testers. No. This is totally unitque, a defining fragrance. Many will come to love it immediately, for me it took several tries before I fell head over heels for Angel. Perhaps it's an aquired taste thing, something that someone under 20 couldn't possibly understand.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"i have been wearing the fragrance for the last 4 years. and let me tell you ""OFF THE CHAIN!!"". i HAVE GROWN MEN, YOUNG BOYS, AND EVEN SOME STRAIGHT WOMEN ASKINGME WHAT I HAVE ON? aND WHERE CANTHEY GET IT?",5,Sephora,us
Angel,THIS IS THE BEST FRAGRANCE I HAVE EVER USED. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT AND HAVE MADE IT MY SIGNATURE FRAGRANCE. I LOVE ALL THE ANGEL PRODUCTS. .,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"This was a wise and excellent purchase. It's less expensive than the perfume, yet stays ALL day and night until you wash your hair again. I'm thrilled with it!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,This scent is my absolute favorite. It's like a day at the beach followed by a warm balmy night on an exotic island. It makes me feel sexy and special. You only need to use a drop and breathe in the magic!!,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"this scent is not one that everyone can wear. I received a sample of the scent after i discovered it on my friend. i had enjoyed the scent so much on her i needed to try it on myself. This scent smelled so much differently on me, it embraced my confidence and my strong will. Yet when my sister tried it, it just was totally wrong. I believe one should get a sample prior to buying.",4,Sephora,us
Angel,Makes me feel young at heart. Everybody always wants to know what I a wearing.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,I was a bit hesitant to buy this without trying it at a store but I took a chance and purchased it anyway. I absolutely love it and I have had many compliments on it so it was worth the price. I am saving up for the body creme now!! It is a good mix of sweet and spice.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I have always been into perfume, but Angel is the absolute best. It has a delicious oriental/musky scent (because of the patchouli and chocolate). However, if you lean more towards floral or girly scents, then Angel is probably not for you. This fragrance is for a strong, confident woman that wants to stand out in a crowd. Oh and trust me you will, because people stop me on the street and tell me that I smell heavenly. So go to a Sephora and try it before you buy it.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"Words escape me. It seems VERY modern, which I don't normally find myself attracted to. But ohhhhh......this morphs me into something new! Makes me rethink everything I know about perfume. Back to school for me.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"got it as a gift and have never smelled anything worse.... I really don't understand how it is so popular, it smells like old rotten sugar yuck!!!",1,Sephora,us
Angel,So I got a little sample of this after I bought some other fragrances. I like this a lot more than Le Lys Angel and Pivione Angel...I guess because this isn't as light as the other two and it seemed to keep its scent longer throughout the day. It's a very romantic scent and I would love to try some of the other products in the regular Angel line sometime!,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"after receiving the sample w/my Sephora catalog, I ordered the trial size of this. I'm still not sure what I think of it. Sometimes it seems too sweet from the start but later in the day, I kinda like it. It does last all day, so that's a plus and I always get compliments on it, even after its been on for hours. I prefer a woody-er scent so this is different for me. I've never been on the fence about a scent, I either like it or hate it immediately and the fact that i'm unsure is different for me. I'm too busy to wonder if I ""feel like wearing it today"". I can see myself getting another tiny one as the firist one has lasted me ages and then I guess we'll wait & see.",3,Sephora,us
Angel,"Wonderful, I receive lots of compliments on the parfum",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"i collect perfumes & this 1 is always a staple which i must have in my collection at all times. i wear it a lot (considering how many perfumes i have) so whenever i run out, i take the bottle in to get refilled at least twice a year. it's good in winter, good in summer. NOTHING smells like it- they try, but this is an original.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I'm one of the rare women that cannot stand this..""fragrance""..the bottle is beautful, but I do not enjoy the woody/musty/expired sugar smell of this perfume. It looks nice on your nighstand, but will not smell nice on your skin..at least not on mine or the tester paper I spritzed it on.",1,Sephora,us
Angel,"This smells like sugar, a sweet dessert, something a child would definitely like. Not so much for an adult woman as for a young teenager, I would say. If you're a fan of the gourmands, then you may like this.",2,Sephora,us
Angel,"Comes in a pretty bottle put does not smell good. When I first sniffed it, the scent was a strange soap like smell and then was a bit spicy. Hard to describe. But very nasty.",1,Sephora,us
Angel,I have been wearing this perfume for over 10 years and it has now become a scent of comfort. It is sexy and fun. When I run out - I feel like I am missing a part of my soul!!,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I'm a perfume addict; I probably have enough scents to last me several years, but I always want more. I was super excited to smell this when I got it as a sample, but one spray had me gagging as the smell was so overwhelmingly strong and was very...""mature"" is the only word I can think of to describe it. I threw away the sample right away; honestly I never want to smell that again.",1,Sephora,us
Angel,This is a delicious layer of Angel. It leaves a light scent in your hair - and doesn't weigh it down!,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"First I must say that the new jar is stunning...too pretty to hide in a cabinet, this is one to be displayed on your dresser...the signature Angel blue color is combined with silver and some silver sparkles to make a beautiful jar.
Filled with the amazing scent of Angel, this lotion is highly scented...some people may even prefer to just wear the lotion and skip the perfume if you want a ""softer"" version. I personally like to layer it in the winter but for spring and warmer months, the lotion is usually all I need.",3,Sephora,us
Angel,Love this!!! It is a scent for all ages!,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"Angel was the first perfume I ever wore & I can tell you it will always be my favorite. If someone asks me what my favorite perfume is I always have the same answer. I always get compliments when I wear it and my husband loves it on me.
If your looking for a great frangrance= please just take one sniff and you will be in love=FOREVER!!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I have worn Angel EVERY day for the past 10 ish years, and the new bottle I got was horrible!!! Nothing like my perfume.........I am confused,! Everyone knows they changed the bottle, but no one said they were changing the actual scent! I am beside myself. People constantly compliment me on my perfume, and the new one smells awful on me. I guess I am back to the drawing board for finding a fragrance.......sigh.....",3,Sephora,us
Angel,I cannot stand wearing perfume.... but this.... this is a whole different scenario! I could bathe in this stuff!!!!,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I just LOVE this scent.... It very distinctive,and stays with me alot longer than other perfumes. It,s a real must try!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,I first met angel around1995-if I remember correctly. I kept going to the store to smell it and i would think so much about it. Then I took the thierry mugler leap of faith. I have been using it ever since-I knoe I love it and to me that's all that matters. I smells suductive and captivating. I can always recongnize it on someone else-although it is very exclusive. A love affair that will probably last a lifetime-thanks for the memerories mr. Mugler.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"this is one of my all time favorite scents. The first time I got a whiff, I was shocked because it wasn't anything like what I expected from it's description. It has such an elegant primary note, and finishes with a warm and sweet familiar tone. Every time I took a sniff I just fell more in love with it. My boyfriend definitely agreed. Love the fact that the bottle is refillable, therefore meaning I don't lose my pretty star bottle and create less landfill refuse is a plus. For the person who wants to make an impact by smelling like something expensive, sensuous, and edible, you should DEFINITELY give this one a try!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"In my opinion, you need the lotion and the fragrance. They balance each other out. Where one leaves off the other takes over.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"Ok, I love it, but my husband hates it. I love Angel and always have. When I would smell it out somewhere on someone els I always just loved it. So, I just went out and bought it. My hsband isn't so fond of it. I think it's one of those that you absolutely have to judge for yourself, but I personally love it.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"This is my all time favorite perfume. I try to switch, but always, always end up back with Angel. It last all day and dosen't take much. If you like it, you will wear it for life...",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I love this fragrance, however, this product does not spray a fine mist like it should. As a result, the product is wasted and the hair is overwhelmed with fragrance.
You would be better off just using the perfume and dabbing behind the ears to achieve the same effect of fragrance in your hair.",2,Sephora,us
Angel,"I tried Angel about 7 years ago and have been a fan ever since. I've tried other fragrances, but I keep coming back to Angel. It is a lush, inviting scent...I never fail to get compliments when I wear it. In fact, I have students at the school where I teach hug me just to get a good whiff...
I do find it is a bit heavy for our hot Texas summers, so I usually wear a lighter scent (like Inner Grace) during the hot, humid months here but come October I break it out and wear it trhough the month of May.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,I have been purchasing Angel for years when I can. It has a scent that I have never found to be achieved in any other perfume. Very ethereal.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,Angel has been my scent since I discovered it 5 years ago. At least once a day someone tells me how good I smell...,5,Sephora,us
Angel,I love it when people comment how good I smell. It gives you confidence when you enter a room and people want to know what you are wearing.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"it's the most intoxicating scent. it's just sooo heavenly and naughty at the same time.., I start my day ~everyday ~with the shower gel and body lotion....",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"The perfume is heavenly. The scent is never overpowering and the bottle is beatiful. It is a
scent that doesn't get old.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"This is a wonderful, unmistakable scent. I have ALWAYS received a ton of compliments since I started wearing this 7 years ago. This is a staple in my scent collection.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,My mom and grandma have worn Angel forever now and it still smells as beautiful as ever! I love it also. Best perfume out there!,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I have been wearing this fragrance since it was introduced, and let me tell you, it drives men crazy!! It is not for everyone, and it does smell a little different on everyone, but it is the only fragrance that men have stopped me and said how amazing it smells. A little goes a long way, but it is sexy, sensual, and definitely grown-up. Even with the chocolate and vanilla notes, it is more spicy than sweet, so if you like sweet scents that make you smell like a candy shop, this isn't for you. This is a fragrance for women, not little girls!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,Worst perfume i've ever scented. Too strong even for strong personalities. to avoid.,1,Sephora,us
Angel,"This sent was very tempting me.First time my friend bought to me a smller one...when it finished...
I started to find the next one...now it's my signature for awhile...I better say thanking my friend...he's open my world...",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I LOVE this scent but was disappointed when I received the ""Shooting Star"" refillable bottle. It was TINY! Get better bang for your buck by spending a little more to purchase the regular, though not as cute, bottle.",4,Sephora,us
Angel,"This has been my signature fragrance for years. I absolutely adore it, and it smells totally incredible on me. That's the tricky part - while it smells amazing with my skin's chemistry, I've smelled it on other people who really should have reconsidered before purchasing it. Don't buy this one blind - get a tester first, and be sure to leave it to develop for at least half an hour, because it changes vastly from when you first apply it. If it works on you, you'll know, because you won't be able to get enough of it (and nor will the people around you.) If it doesn't, you'll know because you'll loathe it.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"This has been one of my favorites for a while. Whenever I wear it, I get a lot of compliments and people want to know what it is, men and women. It is sexy, smooth, and rich. When I wear it, I always feel special.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,This is the best fragrance ever! It is so sophisticated and lovely. It actually puts me in a wonderful mood when I put it on. I wear it year round and would recommend it to anyone who loves spicy and earthy scents.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,I have loved this perfume ever since I found it at Harrod's in London in 1989. It was my signature perfume until my husband gave me Kenzo Flower last year.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"This is my favorite perfume. I only wear it in the fall and winter, because it is a little to heavy and spicy for the warmer weather. My husband cannot get enough of it. His description of it is ""witchy"". I can put on a couple squirts in the morning and still smell it that evening.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"One of my best friends 10 years ago came to my house and the first thing I said to her was, ""What is that amazing smell?"" She replied ""It's called Angel. It has chocolate in it."" I had never heard of a perfume having chocolate back then. With all the new innovative fragrances on the market, this still has a uniquely disctive and magical aroma. It's a whimsical gourmand that is able to maintain a very sophisticated and womanly personna. I actually prefer the body cream because the gourmand sweet smells are much more evident, while the patchouli delicately hinders in the background. If you ever get a chance, try the cream! I have no idea how the manufacturs can pack as much fragrance as they do but a dime size drop is all you need. The best part about winter is getting to don all the cute winter scarves, hats and coats and Angel is by far my favorite winter accessory.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,smells dirty... stay away!! way too strong,1,Sephora,us
Angel,"I'm a girl who only wears florals (Daisy, Romance, Stella), but Angel is by far my favorite, even though it's somewhat different than my ""fragrance personality"". It is surprising and an attention grabber. Don't wear this if you don't want someone to notice you! It is spicy and sexy and I wear it any time I want to feel that way myself!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,Very strong perfume. Smells awesome. One of the best in he market !!!!,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I got this as a gift from my sister, she seems to love it, but to me it is the worst thing i ever smelled... It smells like bug spray to me, and will not come off...it will leave a trace wherever you go!!! My husband couldn't even stand next to me after I sprayed this...I really don't understand how this fragrance can be so popular. Definetly not for me....",1,Sephora,us
Angel,"I never really had a favorite perfume until now. Soft, sensual and clean.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I wore this years ago when I was on vacation in Paris, so every time I wear it, I think of Paris. Love it. Wear it sparingly, though...it can be pretty powerful!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I just bought this perfume in Vegas a couple of weeks ago and I am so hooked on the scent. When I first got my fall Sephora magazine, I found the sampler sheet inside and fell in love. It really is a subtle yet stong enough sent to carry you through the day. Just like an angel!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"It is not often a fragrance comes along that you fall in love with and continue to appreciate through time. Angel is just that scent. Over 10 summers ago I smelled it for the first time and still I love the essence of ""a special occasion"" it gives me. Usually I prefer a very clean and subtle scent but I love the musky, sexy smell and enjoy wearing it anytime I want to feel a bit feisty.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"One of my absolute favorites! Sexy & rich without being over-powering. My boyfriend loves it, too :)",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"too common. of a smell. I can think of over 5 perfumes that smell like this. For people who love candy vanilla creamy perfume this if perfect for you, but I love rare and different smelling stuff. I guarentee if I wore this, 10 people will know what I'm wearing...not for me.",2,Sephora,us
Angel,"I LOVE this scent. It has a great staying power without being overpowering. I believe this can be worn day or night, not a flowery or citrus fragrance.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,I feel like im in a candy factory when i smell this...and not in a good way. It's the sort of sense that is overly sweet to the point where it's kinda gross. i really can not stand this scent.,2,Sephora,us
Angel,"With ANY perfume, the scent reacts differently with each persons skin and body oils. I think each person knows when one works for them. Angel works for me. I get compliments almost every time I wear it. It contains bergamot, which I always look for in a fragrance. If you like Angel, another great one to try is Lolita Lempicka (sp?), which is also available at Sephora.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"With this elegant, rich and sexy fragance i can't but fill like a millionaire!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,There are only two fragrances that stand out for me and only two that people stop me on the street to ask me what I am wearing: Angel and Aromatics Elixer. I found Angel in Italy. I tried it on in the store and I could still smell the gorgeous scent on me when I woke up. I knew I was hooked and still am. Angel is Heaven!,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I remember my mom wearing this scent, and it smelled amazing on her; it smells sweet, almost like chocolate, but not overpoweringly so, and not super edible.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I adore Angel's packaging. what a gorgeous idea to create a glass star that dispenses a fragrance- so nice to take out of your bag. that said, I absolutely loved the sweet, warm top notes of this sky-blue scent. when I first sprayed it, I thought, that's it: I've found my signature fragrance. I love bergamot, which is like the essence of spring. but within a half hour, the dark undernotes began to manifest, and the sweetness faded into a heavy patchouli. I kept my bottle just to enjoy those first whiffs of sweetness and chocolate, but in the end, I gave my bottle away. my pal absolutely loves the fragrance; she's a blonde bombshell, and it suits her. I still miss that bottle and its spiky heft in my hand. oh well...",1,Sephora,us
Angel,"I am so in love with this scent. I've been wearing it for 12 years and can't find anything better. Have purchased other products and they just sit on the shelf. Angel is so long lasting I can put it on in the morning and I'm good all day. AND it's refillable! If you love Angel, get on the mailing list, they sometimes send cute little freebies and samples. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!!!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,i can wear this perfume everyday and never get tired of it. it's well worth trying.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"Angel By Thierry Mugler Is Exactly That:Something Straight From Heaven! I Am 24 Yrs Of Age And Was First Introduced To It When I Was 17,Since That Day My Life Has Truly Never Been The Same! I Wouldnt Go To The Mailbox Without My""Fix""Of Angel For The Day On!I Must Admit This Scent Is NOT For Everyone As It Is Truly A LOVE It Or (I Can Not Believe I Am Going To Say This)Or hate It Scent,Due To Its Unique Qualities!But Dont Hesitate To Try It:Because Once You Do,You Will Most Likely Become A ""Celestial"" Lover Of Angel!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"The first time I purchased this fragrance, I was unsure as to whether or not I truly liked it. After reading about the notes and sorting through mixed reviews, I decided to give it a try. At first, it was intense and seemed to me to be a bit on the masculine side. After the fragrance had time to settle into my skin, I was overwhelmed by how beautiful it was. I wore this when I met my boyfriend and he loved it so much that he purchased a bottle so he could be reminded of me, as we lived in different cities at the time. If you are a fan of Coco Chanel or Gucci Rush, give this one a try, sometime.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"smells overwhemlingly of black licorice on first application. Also a little 'dirty, almost like tabacco? In any case, I find this too strong for me, may work for others.",3,Sephora,us
Angel,"I have been wearing this perfume for years. I love the way it smells. I always get compliments when I have it on and, the refillable star is a added bonus.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"Unbelievable fragrance! Hard for me to put into words what this is like. I have been faithful to this one for years and I will never wear another scent ever again-I knew from the minute I tried it . I wear it all day, every day, even though I live in a warm climate year round. It is strong, so a little goes a long way. Angel works well with my chemistry and doesn't smell funky. If a fragrance can match your personality, then this is it for me. Angel has become my signature fragrance. J'aime Monsieur Mugler!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,It wasn't what i expected - way to strong for my liking!,2,Sephora,us
Angel,"There's something thrilling about this scent for me. It's exciting, a little dark, and heavy--nothing childhood about it! Angel is very much a love it or hate it kind of scent. It's confident and sexy and likely to get the wearer noticed.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I love, love, love this fragrance. Usually I am...ahem...fragrance unfaithful shall we say. This is the only fragrance that I have come back to the well on. I refilled my bottle as a matter of fact. What's to love about Angel? Well, not everyone and their sister or brother is wearing it for one. A little spritz lasts all day. People will actually look at you and say ""you smell really good - what are you wearing?"" And - ta da - its REFILLABLE.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"i love angel, need i say more, love the bottle, love the smell. its very sexy and girly, can't get enough",5,Sephora,us
Angel,This is one of the best perfumes on the market. It has been copied by a lot of other designers but nothing is as good as the original. It is far more complex and sophisticated than the majority of perfumes on the market. It is incredibly sexy and men absolutely love it. My boyfriend and the men I work with constantly tell me they love the way I smell. Hands down this is the best perfume I have ever bought (and I own way more than i should). Wearing this perfume is like wearing Manolo Mary Janes...sweet and innocent on the surface but undeniably sexy.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"Smells so good! It's expensive, but worth every single penny.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"Love this scent. Have worn it for 15 years...
Cannot leave the house without it. Guys love it, but some women don't like it. My boyfriend has the men's version. It's strong, not for someone who like's sweet smells.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"This scent is truly delicious. Even my girlfriends always say, ""GOD YOU SMELL GOOD!"". I highly recommend this scent.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"what a great smell, it is one of the best scents I have ever used! Also you can buy a refill bottle and save money when you want to bye this again, and trust me you will want to buy this scent over and over again.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I smell this product once and afterwards became immediately addicted to it!

This stuff smells literally like Heaven in a bottle. It is ethereal and everytime I smell it, I feel like I am being transcended to another place.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"This is a very pungent mix that smells of essential oils in a new age healing shop. I have gotten about a fifty fifty mix of compliments on the scent and people who hate it.
Again, it is VERY strong so be sure to test it on before you buy it. The little tester cards are not enough in this case...",2,Sephora,us
Angel,My daughter likes this fragrance and I must say that I enjoy it as well. It smells very sweet and it's perfect for any woman to wear.,4,Sephora,us
Angel,"After reading several positive reviews of this product I was anxious to try Angel. Though I have tried several times with Thierry Mugler, I find that I have a hard time wearing this line of scents. Perfumes have a tendency to smell very strong on me (or at least some perfumes with particular notes) and this happens to be one of them. The only smell I was able to pick up in this was almost like pine and was very pungent (perhaps the coumarin or patchouli?), and I found it overwhelming. I wouldn't recommend this product if you prefer something more subtle.",1,Sephora,us
Angel,"My favourite scent. I love that there are so many products available in this fragrance, as many people have mentioned already, it is a heavy scent. I love using the powder & lotion to lighten it up a bit. A tiny bit is all you need!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"This perfume used to be a favorite of mine when I was younger, but now that I have 'grown up', the patchouli scent really doesn't do it for me anymore. I would not recommend this, especially for the workplace or dating.",2,Sephora,us
Angel,"The smells last so long and is so beautiful. It's a very sexy, sexy smell.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I wear many different perfumes, but this is my favorite. It blends in with other smells you may already have on, and covers up smells (like smoke) without being too strong. It is very earthy and sensual. It puts me in the mood as soon as I put it on.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I have gotten so many compliments on this perfume- it smells amazing, it is in fact enchanting! This fragrance is timeless, perfect for any occasion, not too strong, just right!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,another favorite of mine i used to dab some behind my ears and i'd get so many compliments,5,Sephora,us
Angel,I really don't care for this scent even though it is very unique. I felt that it was too strong and overpowering. At best it's only good to wear in the evening- not too much of a day scent. It's a scent you either love or hate.,2,Sephora,us
Angel,"ah, this one is a classic for me. i got it as a gift years ago, and to this day it is still one of my favourites. it's a very unique and bold scent with notes of grapefruit, patchouli, amber, and chocolate. a lovely and creative bit of mischief from our beloved thierry mugler.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,I love this! Very soft and feminine without being flowery.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I sniffed and tested this on my wrist a few times before falling in love with it. It's a mix of a few scents - berries, chocolate, caramel, patchouli. They come together in different ways. It's not a summer scent and it's not for the shy. Many have copied, but few have succeeded in making such a unique fragrance. The bottle is beautiful too.
I also love that it's refillable.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I've heard people either love or hate this chocolately grapefruity scent, and I'm definitely in love with it. Most perfumes smell pretty much the same to me...I think I pick up on the scent of the alcohol before anything else. In my 40 years, I've found only 4 scents that really stand out for me, and this is one of them. When I wear it, the warm, sweet complex smell is so intoxicating, I just get lost in it. The first time I tried it, I couldn't stop sniffing at my wrist for an hour! It's a fragrance you absolutely can't be indifferent to. Whether you end up loving it or hating, you have to try it!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"When I first smelled this perfume I absolutely hated it. One night my friends sprayed me with the perfume before we went out. I received so many compliments that night when we were out eating and out on the town!
The perfume is strong, but it is great for nights out. If you want a perfume to wear to work, you must use very little for it not to overpower your co-workers.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I remember when this fragrance first became all the rage. It's graduated to CLASSIC. You'll turn heads with this fragrance...one spritz is enough to carry you through the day with a rich, powdery scent.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"though it smelled intriguing in the bottle, I found this perfume to have a much more potent (and unattractive) odor when I put it on. the women at the Sephora counter assured me that it takes time to develop, but I ended up smelling more like a pine-scented air freshener than anything else. not sure what was going on - probably my own body chemistry - but I found the perfume to be a bit too much for my own tastes.",2,Sephora,us
Angel,"This is a pretty perfume but not for everyday wear. Its heavy. Also, it seems more wintery maybe than summery. I bought it in Miami, so maybe I will find myself wearing it in New York this winter. It didnt make the cut for hot humid Miami.",3,Sephora,us
Angel,"Long-lasting, unique fragrance",5,Sephora,us
Angel,It is great! My husband loves it when I wear it. Even my Kindergarten students compliment my fragrance. I've even heard the students from next door say that they know I've been in their classroom.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,Best for all seasons! It's so long lasting that it still scents in the shower at night after early-morning application!,5,Sephora,us
Angel,A sensual fragrance without being a cliche of sexiness. Reminiscent of chocolate without smelling like a cookie.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"This is in the top three of my favorite fragrances. There is never a time when I wear this, that I don't receive a compliment or someone ask, ""What is that fragrance your wearing, it smells wonderful!""",5,Sephora,us
Angel,This is a lovely perfume. I would strongly recommend it. It makes you smile when you wear it.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,I remember this perfume because I used to use when I was younger. I'll never forget it. It's an amazing scent that sort of reminds of indian incense. The scent stays on all day and is very sensual.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"A rich and dreamy fragrance. I have yet to wear this and not be stopped by someone wanting to know what I'm wearing. This is a very sensual fragrance that can be worn at any time of day, any time of year.The Chocolate and patchouli in this just sends it over the 5 stars!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,It really smells like toilet bowl cleaner. And I am not the only one to make that comment about it.,1,Sephora,us
Angel,"I love this scent. I was introduced at a Nordstorm Trend Show. The scent is so me!!! It makes me feel beautiful. And beyond that, you can refill the star bottle and not have to buy new bottles each time. What a great deal!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"The only frangrance I wear, both men and women ask what it is",5,Sephora,us
Angel,This is THE most amazing fragrance on the shelves. It is so classy and beautiful. Angel lasts literally ALL day long...there is no need to reapply. I would recommend this fragrance to EVERYONE. It is amazing.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"Normally I like florals, particularly jasmine, tuberose, etc. Angel by Thierry Mugler is a great alternative, providing sweetness and warmth with honey notes whiles still remaining fresh and rather intoxicating.
The one down side, everyone wants to have their own signature sent which no one else is quite able to place... let alone where themselves. Because of increasing popularity of this frangrence,",4,Sephora,us
Angel,"Wearer beware, this is one intense scent! Every time I'm in the store and take a whiff of this, I fall in love all over again. The smell is just divine - sweet, caramelly, warm. Unfortunately, the second it is on me, I can't stand it. It is just too strong and overbearing. I wish I could wear it but it will never happen.",4,Sephora,us
Angel,"This scent is dreamy and soft....it lasts all day long with beautiful top, middle, and end notes. My husband thinks it is the best that I own! People comment on it all the time and they love it too!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"this fragrance is very distinctive. people will ask if you are wearing angel. usually followed up by, "" i love the way that smells""",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"Angel has become one of my favorite perfumes. I love all the variations of Angel that were released, but the original is the best. It's floral but sweet at the same time, but it is strong, so just one spray should be good. I also wouldn't wear this during the summer; it would be too overwhelming.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"since I have worn this perfume, I have received compliments about its warm undertones, exotic sent and the soft lingering after notes. There has not been any negative comments concerning this perfume.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"This is one of my favorite perfumes. I have been wearing it now for some years. Throughout those years I have received many compliments (especially from men). The scent is very distinct and has a strong character, but non-the-less is very feminine.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"Simply playful and womanly, it is most captivating.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,i love angel! it is fresh and unique and has a smell that lingers. i enjoy it,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"smells fine.
honestly not that impressed.",3,Sephora,us
Angel,"this fragrance is amazing and although a little pricey it is worth every penny. with only a few sprays you will continue to smell like the fragrance all through the night....and probably the next day as well if you don't shower. haha. also, the smell changes as the night progresses and only gets better!! its a little strong at first but its a very elegant perfume for all ages! love it!!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"This scent is so captivating! It is impossible to ignore, bold, and makes a sexy statement. Immediately, it makes one take notice with its decadent dessert notes. Caramel, cocoa, and incense are not mild scents! Incredibly alluring, but too strong for day wear, IMHO. Still, it is one of the sexiest scents I have encountered. I will save it for sultry nights in.",4,Sephora,us
Angel,"I love this perfume! It is so delicious. I wear it all the time. I really like the fact that they have come out with a refillable bottle now too, that is so environmentally friendly of them. I love to wear this perfume out when I am going to be dancing, because I have noticed when your body heats up the fragrance becomes stronger.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"There are some perfumes that just make you stop... this one stops most people who walk by me, to ask what I am wearing. It's intoxicating - and it makes you feel pretty :-)""",5,Sephora,us
Angel,I started wearing this at least 12 years ago.I always get compliments on it.My 3 daughters love it.Every once and a while I try something new but I always go back to it.It is my scent!,5,Sephora,us
Angel,This scent is as addictive as the chocolate that it touts. It has a very distinctive spicy scent that is unmistakable. I have received many compliments while wearing it and is my most-every-day regular perfume. I ask for it every Christmas and it remains my favorite all time scent.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"This is my go to perfume for specail occasions! I always get compliments when I wear this fragrance!
I only spray a little b/c it can be a bit strong, but it fades to a whisper as the day progesses and it smells amazing!",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"My SIL was wearing this one day and smelled wonderful so i immediatly went out and purchased it. IT was horrible wearing it! No matter how long i wore it for or how little i put on, it was just too strong! (i thought the same when the SIL had it on but figured she wore too much!) I returned it after a few days of horrified looks.",2,Sephora,us
Angel,"This is my absolute favorite fragrance I have ever worn. I get so many compliments, from men and women...and I love how it smells like a mixture of chocolate and vanilla.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"The fragrance is too strong and sweet for me. It is strong, strong, strong. People will notice, that's for sure.",2,Sephora,us
Angel,"I am not a flowery girl, more a vanilla-musk-woodsy type. This is perfect and my favorite so far for when the weather is cooler when wearing a cozy sweater, but it is great year-round too. The scent stays true from the first spritz and does not fade, but to me is not overpowering. Perfect balance!",4,Sephora,us
Angel,"Sweet, dreamy, the name says it all. Angel. Wow. This is one of earths fine pleasures. Refillable, the bottle is nice on the eyes. A heavenly gift for yourself you someone you love very much. Special.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"This has a pleasant scent which men compliment alot and ask what it is? It is supposed to smell like cotton candy and it has a scent that I think reminds one of food, or dessert....which men love.",4,Sephora,us
Angel,"I used to be an ""Opium"" wearer. Then I smelled ""Angel"" on a co-worker (I followed her through the office to find out what she had on.). This scent is dreamy and light. Notes of Patchouli and Vanilla - I love it and apparently a lot of others do too. I get nothing buy compliments on it. I think that the body lotion smells even better than the perfume.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,This is my favorite fragrance and I always get compliments on it. It is really beautiful and different. My favorite!,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I only became aware of Angel because a very sexy man I know wears Angel for Men, which is amazing. Angel for women has many of the same notes, but is more feminine. It has an amazing combination of chocolate, sandalwood, and spice that smells incredible on the right person. Thankfully it works with my chemistry because I really wanted to like it. I LOVE the Celestial Body Lotion which has long staying power, the EDP is great too, but expensive. I can't wait to try the hair mist! I'm sold on Angel, all the way, and have gotten compliments from men and women on this fragrance.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I have gone back to this fragrance again and again over the past 7 years. And every time I get it, I remember why I didn't like it. It's wonderful when you first put it. Very chololatey and fun. But when it dries down, it smells like a spicy piece of wood. The smell is horrible. I try to force myself to get pass it, but also end up giving my newly purchased bottle away. It must be my body chemestry.",1,Sephora,us
Angel,"I didn't like this fragrance. I gave it a try several times before I gave up on it. I tried wearing just a little, but perhaps my chemistry is not suited for it. To me, there was a heavy note of almost like Patchulli that didn't fade as time went on. It just wasn't for me.",2,Sephora,us
Angel,I get more compliments when I wear this perfume than any other. It's beatiful and I hope to keep it for life!!,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"This is the only perfume I wear. Most give me migraines, but this smells wonderful.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"Some people have complained that Angel is too strong or overpowering. While not all scents work the same with everyone's chemistry, this perfume is specifically memorable, beautiful, and even tantallyzing when used judicially.
The vanilla, chocolate and mix of light spices have always had men and women alike and often young men asking me what the beautiful scent is. But I will warn, if you can smell it after you have placed a touch behind the ears, one on the throat and on the wrists--and I mean a touch--you have put on too much.
Thiis perfume 'Less is More.'",5,Sephora,us
Angel,"i love this scent so much, i even wore it on my wedding day. it just smells so delicious, and it lasts.",5,Sephora,us
Angel,I absolutely love this fragrance. It's very subtle and distinctive. Its scent is very ethereal and makes me feel very feminine. I almost feel as though I am in another place while wearing Angel.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,When i wear this I get so many compliments. The scent isn't too strong just enough to get noticed. My daughter loves it too.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,This is the most delicious perfume. Men always compliment me when I wear it.,5,Sephora,us
Angel,"I love ANGEL,very distinctive scent with great staying power.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"When you get compliments daily whenever you wear this and it lasts throughout the day without having to spray every other hour. Also, love the eco friendly packaging, where you are able to refill the bottle instead of buying an entire new one. To me this is my scent when I want to feel sexy or I’m on a date. I definitely prefer it more during the night and fall and winter.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,This perfume is the most delicious and satisfying smell. I found out about this perfume because a coworker was wearing it and I hunted down the smell in the hallways. I ALWAYS get stopped by peers and coworkers and neighbors because they want to know what my perfume is. PLUS it's cheaper when you refill it instead of buying a new bottle!,5,Sephora,us
Alien,This is my favorite perfume of all time. It's dark and mysterious and just so beautiful. I can't get enough of it. It stays on very well.,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I wanted to love this perfume so badly but I unfortunately cannot stand it. I agree with some other reviewers notions that it smells like grandma perfume and it lasts ALL DAY! If you like the scent, that’ll be a huge positive for you. For me the scent is unbearable, and gives me the worst headaches. I can’t say I understand the hype on this one!",1,Sephora,us
Alien,"I received a sample of this with an order and after one use, bought the full size.  Jasmine is my favorite flower and it's the main note in my go to fragrance, Donna Karan Cashmere Mist, so I'm not surprised I love this as well. I can definitely smell the jasmine but the other notes give it a warmth that is perfect for fall and winter.  It lasts most of the day on me and is not too much in smaller spaces like my office.  I can't recommend it enough!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,I am here to tell you you need this perfume. I was never a huge perfume girl and typically wouldn't spend this much money on perfume but I had to have this once I smelled it. I have the lotion as well. Every single time I wear it I get a compliment I seriously love this perfume so much I cannot go without it,5,Sephora,us
Alien,Sweet and sexy - a little goes a long long way - but just a small amount smells honeysuckle sweet.  Not too overpowering one squirt on the wrist is enough,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"So funny most of the negative reviews refer to it as a ""grandma perfume"".
it smells EXACTLY like Elizabeth Taylor's Diamonds. Which is a fraction of the price at CVS somewhere.",1,Sephora,us
Alien,"I got this as a free sample and thought I’d like it because of all the great reviews but absolutely not! It has a weird minty old lady smell that heavy and nauseating. It’s honestly the worst smelling perfume I’ve tested. Thankfully I didn’t blind buy. Definitely not something I’d purchase, ever. If it were possible, I’d give this monster 0 stars.",1,Sephora,us
Alien,"I constantly get compliments when I wear this perfume. It is not too sweet, it is more of a musk with a unique twist. 

When in doubt, purchase this perfume because its universally loved. The best gift!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,This is my favorite scent for fall. It lasts all day long with just one spray- even after I scrub it off in the shower! I get a lot of compliments on this perfume and the best part is that my boyfriend loves it too!,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"Honestly one of the best fragrances I've ever smelled! It's extremely long lasting and even when I get home and remove my clothes, I can still smell it on them.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,I love this perfume! It is my signature scent I wear all the time! I always reach for this over any other perfume I have.,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"Love this fragrance, have all Mugler perfumes and by far this is my favorite.. Sexy scent!!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"Such a lovely, unique fragrance! It inspires creativity! It's a bit stronger than I am used to, but I absolutely love it! The packaging is gorgeous!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,its amazing smells like gardenias which are my fav I highly recommend,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"Alien is such a unique scent. There is nothing else like it; it is in a category all it’s own. It is intense, mysterious, uplifting and sexy! I believe this is technically considered a gourmand fragrance, which is definitely not for everyone. But I can tell you any time I wear it, I get tons of compliments.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,,1,Sephora,us
Alien,,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"i loved the smell of angle but after trying it a couple of times, it was just too much for me. the smell is awesome on other people but just didn't work on me, so i tried alien and loved it.It is really nice and every so often i'll smell it on myself and love it over and over again.i would suggest to try a sample first because i know someone that was the other way around. Angle worked for her but not alien so try it they both are really nice, just different . See whats best for you..",5,Sephora,us
Alien,My new go to. I had sprayed a little on at a Sephora around my way and the whole ride home i was amused by the smell and i couldn't quite figure out what i kept smelling. I then got home and when i went to pick my hair up i got a whiff of the smell on my wrist and said OMG is the perfume from sephora. I literally got out of bed early the very next day and went and purchased it.I wore it the same day and people were literally stopping me at the lounge i was in to ask me what i was wearing. Today at work 4 of my patients urged for me to give them the name of this perfume because it smelled so good. MY NEW ADDICTION,5,Sephora,us
Alien,I love this fragrance. It lasts all day.,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"This scent is perfect for a night out. It is strong, but not over baring. When I asked my boyfriend what he thought of it, he said it was like a scent a girl would use for a night out at the club and I totally agree. Not really an everyday thing, but still fresh and worth the investment! And plus that the packaging is SO aesthetic.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,Love this scent -- very beautiful and light.,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"YMMV! Very torn on this scent. I had quite liked the way it smelled on a friend, very clean and basic, so I waited several months for the sale to buy it. My perfumes prior to this were Tom Ford Oud and Noir, CLEAN, and the Kandilli perfume oil, among some other niche ones from other countries. This is very different, toned down and uncomplicatedly clean. If you're the type of person that is more concerned with being able to distinguish notes in a fragrance, steer clear of this. If you like unisex scents, STEER CLEAR! This is not a heady layered scent, and (sorry to some folks) this is not quite 'mature' either. This is my 'have fun' scent, and I will say it lives up to that.",4,Sephora,us
Alien,"I have had my eye on this scent for a while but was hesitant that it would be too heavy for warmer weather. I went to my nearby store and made the mistake of spraying it directly onto my arm. It is very strong, though not quite aggressively so (but close), and smelled vaguely medicinal when first sprayed but that part soon faded. After the initial smell, it became an intoxicating warm sweet floral, though not too warm for sticky Maryland summers. I love it but really would warn against direct skin spray because it can be Too Much",4,Sephora,us
Alien,"This isnt a scent I would typically gravitate to but it’s quite intriguing! It is very simple: jasmine floral top note, warm wood middle note and amber base. So you get a warm powdery musk scent. 

I would say this is better suited for cooler weather as a lot of musk scents can be off putting in the heat. 

Its soft enough to wear during the day but jasmine, woods and amber are all very sexy notes on their own so combined they make a great combo for an evening out. 

If you like the musk scents of Narciso Rodriguez For Her you might really enjoy this one. Once my sample runs out I may purchase this for winter date nights but for me it wouldn’t be an everyday fragrance.",4,Sephora,us
Alien,"This scent just wasn't for me. It wasn't unpleasant, but to me it has a strong grandmother scent. It's floral and soft. However, the fragrance smells too reminiscent of baby powder and hugging your great aunt.",2,Sephora,us
Alien,"My fave .........
This perfume is one of the best perfumes ever",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"Not sure what happened. Years ago I loved it and finished an entire bottle. Needing a perfume that will last and last, I remembered this perfume having great staying power so I bought it again. But now, I can’t even smell it on myself? Formula must have changed as I haven’t worn this in years and am not used to the scent anymore. Doesn’t last like it used to.",2,Sephora,us
Alien,My One and Only perfume ❤️,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"Unlike any other fragrance I’ve smelled. Very unique, long lasting but not overwhelming. The perfect date night and “night out” perfume. I wouldn’t recommend this for daytime, workplace wear but some people could probably pull this off as an “everyday” scent. I don’t feel like I personally could, but it does smell amazing and is very sexy, a little musky, a little sweet and a hint of spice. Amazing complex fragrance and if you’re looking for something different, this is it!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,A single sniff I’ve got from a sample was only good enough to tell me - I don’t like the scent. At least it did not last long enough to worry,2,Sephora,us
Alien,"This is PURE FLOWER POWER. people that say it doesnt smell like a real flower obviously haven't been around them to much. That is the first note. Beautiful real jasmine. Then the sexy hits. It's an alluring daring sex filled day dream. It has hints of vanilla and amber but that jasmine is the top note and most noticeable. I can smell it on me after about 3 sprays on my neck, and it really stays for about 4 hours or longer. Atleast with my chemistry. This perfume isnt for the candy loving juveniles, it is a sexy independent woman in a bottle. And as mr. Mugler says it's meant to be worn on a woman and enjoyed by a man. My husband who HATES perfume almost fell over when he smelt this. He cant get enough. I will say it isnt for everyone. If you enjoy things like britney spears and ariana grande or Prada candy stay far away. Leave this one to the grown folks ;)",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I absolutely love this scent!! I have a huge collection of perfumes, approaching 100 bottles - it's a hobby that makes me happy - don't judge! ; ) - and this one is among my top 10, maybe even top 5. I adore jasmine, and this is a very interesting take on it. Extremely well blended, it is difficult for me to describe the various notes and facets. All I can say is that when I spray this on, I swoon from it's beauty.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,I love this...smell so good,5,Sephora,us
Alien,This and the Dior Absolutely Blooming are my go to! This scent is so strong and lasts SO long! My entire car trunk smells amazing because I left a jacket in it with some of Alien sprayed on it.,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I have used this perfume for 8 years. To this day I get compliments from friends family and even strangers. People would randomly ask what perfum I’m wearing, I didn’t think it was impressive until I received my 10th compliment.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,Smell is so beautiful and sexy ! One of my favourite! Definitely a nice smell for a evening out !,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"This is a strange perfume. Without a doubt. You'll never smell anything like it.

It's like a slightly less grapey version of cough syrup, with a strong warmth that makes it feel like it's... Rotting? I can't quite describe the way that the scent dries down.

Try it out if you can, because it is worth every penny--the scent lasts all day, and you only need approx. three sprays for a maximum effect. The sprayer disperses the product beautifully, and it dries down super quickly.

I can't recommend this unique fragrance enough.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,Never have I been so addicted to a perfume before. I put it on and instantly feel so happy and warm. Will probably wear this for the rest of my life! I got a sample of it and then a small bottle and now I’m onto the big bottle and I hate running out,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"Absolutely LOOVEE this scent. I never get tired of it, I already bought a refill because I ran out and I HAD to get more! You can’t go wrong with this scent its so elegant and I always get compliments on it.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,I have gotten many compliments when wearing Alien . It’s soft yet has great sillage . If you love Jasmine you will def love Alien . Most fragrances don’t last on me but I get hours of fragrance with Alien . I will def repurchase this in a heartbeat . Love Alien . Seductive and mysterious.,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I’ve worn the same scent for over 10 years and was thinking I needed to switch it up. Received this from a friend as a birthday gift in July and I was skeptical, but I have been using it ever since. I have NEVER received as many compliments about ANYTHING as I have about this scent. Coworkers, Uber drivers, baristas at the coffee shop...everyone mentions how good I smell (and I smoke!). I can’t tell you how many times I’ve had to write it down for other women AND men wanting to purchase. LOVEEEE.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,Smells great! Such a unique scent!,5,Sephora,us
Alien,Hands down my favorite perfume. I have always wore high end perfumes and this one is by far the best one. I get asked what I wear all the time because people love the way it smells.,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"Words cannot describe!!!! This perfume is simply amazing an d very suitable for ages 20 and up! I love this, this is one gem that will remain in m collection. Plus it lasts all day until your next shower!!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"the sample i got literally was so different than the actual product ?? it was mysterious, white musky super elegant. i was so in love with it i couldnt stop smelling it on the paper and it also lasted a couple of weeks , the smell didnt change. (but honestly i hate that the sample i got was in a paper package and not in a little vial) then when i ended up buying the product it turned out to be disgustingly strong and nothing like the light but powerful perfume i had in my sample. im so upset i dont know why the product i bought is so gross and really typical to a cheap drugstore brand.",1,Sephora,us
Alien,My favorite perfume EVER. Scent lasts all day.,5,Sephora,us
Alien,I received this perfume as a sample and I was sold! I just bought the full size product last week because I missed it too much.,5,Sephora,us
Alien,beautiful intense scent,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"At first I was weirded out because....well, Aliens?
I received and tried a sample of this and after a few minutes letting it settle in with my body chemistry, it just smelled Amazing. I couldn't stop smelling myself. I HIGHLY recommend you try it.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I received a sample and sprayed it directly on my wrist. My initial thought was 'Ewww! Grandma perfume' but when it dried down it became a warm, delicious sensual, gourmand scent ... it is the type of scent that usually has a musky undertone that I dislike but this doesn't which makes it amazing, I cannot stop smelling my wrist when I spray it and constantly receive compliments.

Highly recommend trying it and letting it settle on your skin",5,Sephora,us
Alien,Fragance is so sensual. The best sample packaging ive seen.,5,Sephora,us
Alien,Love it! A little goes a long way!,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"The. Best. Ever. 
-The end.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,I have already purchased the 2 OZ bottle and have already refilled it twice. This will be my forever favorite. No joke. The longer you wear it the better it smells!!! I promise,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"it's my signature, and that best  that's it .",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I've only received samples so far. I went to the local Sephora to purchase Angel but, they didn't carry it in the store. I tried Alien to see if I loved it as much and I don't. It is a nice scent but, a little too sweet. I prefer the dark undertones of Angel. If you like Angel but like sweet notes, this scent will be good for you.",4,Sephora,us
Alien,"Smelled it on one person once and it impacted my mind instantly. It is an easy fragrance to recognize. I think it is very potent and unique. Its not your typical perfume and I don’t think its for anyone. It is bold and very assertive. I realize a lot of people say its floral and I agree, but theres a grape scent to it as well. I would not recommend it for an all year round perfume. I’d say its a fall scent and you could pull it off in winter for sure, but its not suitable for the summer heat. I just don’t think its that kind of hot beachy vibe. Overall, I love this scent and I would say it’s my favorite perfume.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,I love this perfume so much! I always get compliments when I wear it!! It’s such a nice smell it’s not overpowering!,4,Sephora,us
Alien,There was a doctor where I work that wore this amazing perfume everyday. I would oddly asked to smell her all the time. I finally broke down and ordered my own. I LOVE it. *wearing it now*  The bottle is also very beautiful. I have no complaints at all.,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I received a sample sprayer of this with a Sephora order and I am so ready to purchase in full size (plus get the matching body care items)!! I have a sensitive nose, but this does not irritate me at all to smell, and the scent lasts all day. It has a floral, honeysuckle like note to it that I appreciate it. It reminds me of my country home",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I love this perfume so much. It stays and stays and stays. It’s unique and powerful. The scent is hard to describe, sweet and sexy and slightly floral. I have not found anything like this.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"This is the only perfume I wear. I get so, so many compliments on it! It’s my favorite.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"Alien is a scent I can never properly describe, but it's sweet and oriental... if I had to describe it. 
It's not like any other perfume I've tried before and I'm hooked. 
It lasts a solid 4-5 hours, but it's on the pricier side. 
They do have a refill bottle instead of buying a new bottle which is better for the environment and your wallet! 
I can talk about alien for hours but if you have any questions feel free to ask me! I've been wearing it for the last 5 years since 2013 ... since I was 15! Wow. I think that speaks a lot about the perfume and brand!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I'm on my third or forth bottle of Alien at this point and it is my absolute favourite scent of all time! People ask me what I am wearing all of the time (sometimes I don't want to tell them because I want it to remain a mystery). The scent is long-lasting and unique, it works great with my body chemistry.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,My all time favourite perfume. Love the smell and lasts all day. I get compliments all day long.,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"This my favorite perfume on earth!!!!!! Is very strong and makes feel powerful. Every single time I wear it someone compliments me. It’s awesome!!!!!! 
It also last on me for hoursssssss. If you like strong perfume there is no other choice but this!!!!!!!! I’m on my 3rd bottle.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"Love, love, love. My partner and and I have been on the hunt for a perfume we both love on me, and it's been rough since we have very contrasting tastes in perfume. I'd come across the Mugler line awhile ago and originally found myself really underwhelmed, but Angel had grown on me. So when it came time to pick out a new one, I immediately took him to their new perfume, Aura, due to the bottle being his favorite color. Imagine my surprise that he liked Alien instead! Something about it kept drawing him back to the sample card, even without me telling him which one it was. I took that as my hint to buy this one pronto. We bought the Seducing Stone, because at the moment $84 is a little steep for us and the smaller bottle is still refillable, so I nabbed during the VIB sale. It does need to be shipped Ground due to the nature of the bottle, so shipping did take longer than expected, but that wasn't a big issue- it arrived in once piece and not broken. I've been wearing it every day since, and suffice to say that everyone wants to be around me all the time. I guess I've found my go-to perfume! Will definitely be refilling until they stop making this bottle.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,I got so many compliments  when I put this fragrance on me .I love how this perfume smells on me.This fragrance is unique.beside you can refill the bottle as many times you want,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"Absolutely love this perfume! When I first bought myself the small bottle, my mom would compliment me and one day it was gone out of my room. Guess where I found it? In her room! Anyways, she bought me a new bottle and we both just loved it! I showed my neighbour who loves Dior hypnotic and she says this smells SO good. 

Not the typical floral smell, but strong and sexy!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"Amazing. Sexy. DIFFERENT. This was made for me. It is sexy, sweet and dark. If all the other perfumes disappeared and this was the only one that survived, i would not be mad.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,Absolutely love this perfume,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"Have bought and re-bought.  Little goes a long way.  Love the bottle too.  Sexy but not just an ""evening"" scent.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"BEST perfume ever. probably gone through 10  bottles. It stays on for sooo long and l love how everyone wears the scent differently.. every time someone is near me i've heard people say ""who's wearing alien?"".. such a great noticeable smell that actually stays on. DEFENITLEY sign up for theiry mugler online and put the code from each product.. you get free random alien gifts.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,my favourite scent ever- definitely nothing like any other perfume i've smelled but in a good way! very unique,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"This has been my favorite perfume for a few years now. It's such a pleasing scent, lasts a long time, and is never too overpowering. If you want to be obsessed with smelling yourself all day, this is the perfume to wear.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"LOVE this perfume! I originally​ got a sample in the mail and fell in love.  I ended up ordering some from Macy's and it was NOT the same product, it almost smelled rancid.  If you don't like this perfume, chances are its a fake!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"Awesome scent! It's a combination of spice and sweetness with a little musk..Idk, it's very different in a great way! Plus it lasts ALL DAY! I was very surprised but pleasantly pleased. Do not regret this purchase!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,This one is way out of my preferences when it comes to fragrance. But somehow it caught me! The scent is very strong and heavy. A little bit will do. This one pairs great with cold weather! (: It smells great. I can see why this one is very popular!,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"Just awful. Classic ""grandma"" scent. Extremely strong and headache inducing.",1,Sephora,us
Alien,"Extraordinary and beautiful. Alien will be loved and worn 100 years from now, and beyond.  Like Chanels, which are a continual part of olfactory history, Mugler's fragrances are legendary. Alien's jasmine is singularly powerful, and once you've smelled it, you'll never forget it. As long as Alien isn't oversprayed, it's alluring and luxurious. When it's oversprayed, however, it takes on a life of its own. Be careful if you wear this and love it, you may be wearing too much and not realizing it. When I first smelled Alien, years ago, it gave me such a migraine I reacted like it was poison every time I got a slight whiff of it.  Many years after that, I wear Alien myself and find it dazzling. It's best when it lingers like a secret, on my wrists, or the back of my neck. I am very glad I gave Alien a second chance, because its a joy to wear. The amethyst bottle is gorgeous, and it looks fabulous in my perfume collection.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,I cant get enough........prepare for an addiction,5,Sephora,us
Alien,I want to hate it.  It smells so strange but I keep coming back for it.,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"This is amazing, however, it's too strong to the point that I rarely wear it,",4,Sephora,us
Alien,"I got a free sample of this awhile back with one of my online orders, and i have to say this perfume is amazing. It holds throughout the day which is so rare for the other perfumes I've tried and I get tons of compliments!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,This is my holy grail perfume. The best smelling perfume I have ever smelled. So mysterious and lasts a long time. I always get compliments when I wear this.,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"Có thể nói là mùi rất thơm và sang. Giữ hương tầm 4 đến 8 tiếng. Chị em nên mua nhé. 
Thơm vcl thơm vclllllllll",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"This perfume smells horrible. It made me smell like that typical “grandma perfume smell” and it was so strong, I was wheezing. Don’t buy this.",1,Sephora,us
Alien,ѕeхххy and everyone wιll coмplιмenт yoυr perғυмe wнιle wearιng тнιѕ!,5,Sephora,us
Alien,Been using this fragrance over 10 yrs it’s amazing❤️,5,Sephora,us
Alien,The smell is amazing and the scent lasts all day and night! I will be purchasing more,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"The name does not do this fab scent any justice! This is a soft, sexy, powdery perfection! I get compliments on it EVERYDAY!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,Alien was a Christmas present for my beautiful beloved daughter Keke. Alien is her all time favorite.,5,Sephora,us
Alien,I love this scent! I usually go for lighter scents but I couldn’t pass this up. This was my first dip into more expensive fragrances and it’s well worth the money to me. Great with the body lotion and shower milk.,5,Sephora,us
Alien,my top fav perfume ever! this is long lasting beautiful scent. i receive so many compliments when i wear this fragrance!,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"This perfume is so beautiful. It is very unique, unlike any other scent I have smelled. All of the notes lay together perfectly. This is would definitely be more of a night time or autumn/ winter scent for most people, however, I think you could get away with it anytime. Also, this last forever on me. I really like the bottle. It reminds me of some kind of crystal.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"This reminds me of Estée Lauder's modern muse but on steroids!  I like modern muse when it dries down, but not initially.  This was far too overbearing, very strong notes of tuber rose and jasmine. To me it smells like the air freshener people kept in there bathrooms in the 80s.  Not a good scent for me.  Ten minutes after I put it on I had to wash it off, and wash the cloths I was wearing.  I found it headache inducing almost nauseating.  I couldn't wear it long enough to see if it dried down to a more pleasing scent.",1,Sephora,us
Alien,I've always been a fan of muskier scents and this one takes the cake! It's sultry and sexy and makes me feel like a goddess!,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"My best friend has been wearing this fragrance for forever and I've always loved! It's so unique, strong (but not too strong), memorable, and warm. I think some other reviewer called it ""moody"" and I think that's a perfect description. To me its not floral-y or fruit-y scent, more of a spice or earth smell. However, it still manages to be delicate and balanced. Anyway, its hard to describe smells but I highly recommend!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I will forever love Mugler perfumes. I’m a longtime fan of Angel. When I first sprayed this on the paper I thought it smell awful; however, like all Mugler perfumes it’s so much better on. When I sprayed it on myself, I still wasn’t sure and then it grew and grew on me. Now I can’t get enough of it. It’s very strong, but it’s a very sexy scent and I don’t even like florals usually! Highly recommend",5,Sephora,us
Alien,Excellent fragrance.. I never paid attention to it until I tried on .. it stays all day long. You have to let it stay. This type of fragrance smells different on everyone so it’s like a Alien. It takes personality. Signature fragrance I recommend it!,5,Sephora,us
Alien,This is truly one of the best high end perfumes I own. The smell is so sensual and so sexy yet slightly floral and just a little woodsy that all make a beautiful combination. Out of all the high end perfumes I own(about 8) this is the longest lasting. It stays all day with only two sprays and I'm a nanny who's constantly on the move. Will definitely be buying again.,5,Sephora,us
Alien,My signature fall perfume. One spray and you’re good to go. It lasts all day. I’ll repurchase once this bottle is over,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I can usually find SOMEthing to like about a perfume, but this one defies description (although I’ll try). I received a sample with an order and dabbed a little on my wrist. It is, hands down, the single worst scent I’ve ever worn. Every note was displeasing. It’s odor is only eclipsed by its staying power. I struggled to delete the product from my skin. Upon returning to my seat, I discovered that it has hang time. The air still reeked. This may or may not be your cup of tea, but I urge you to sample it before buying.",1,Sephora,us
Alien,"This perfume smells so good, and it lasts for such a long time! originally I got it as a sample size with another purchase, and decided to buy an actual size once I used the sample! I used two sprays of the sample and went to class, my friend said I smelled really good but maybe I should just stick with one spray next time (lol). I didn’t realize one spray could go so far, so I won’t be making that mistake again with this perfume. I love that so little can go such a long way though, and especially love the smell.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"LOVE. Unique, bold, and not too strong. Great for a night out.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"Honestly I'm in love with it, whenever I use it, it makes me feel confident, sexy and happier.
It doesn't matter where I go, there's always at least one person complimenting me and/or asking me what perfume I'm using.
Will definitely repurchase it.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"This has been one of my main perfumes since high school, (I rotate between this, and two others based on the time of year), and like many other reviews I do have to tell you it is overpowering at first. It fades nicely on me, but I suggest trying a sample of it for a few hours first since my roommate didn't think it wore well on her. Great fall-spring scene or a night scent, but it is a bit heavy for really hot/humid weather, hence my rotation. Its SO UNIQUE in its scent, I can't even place the notes, but there's nothing else like it out there. So far its mainstream enough to find places to get it refilled easily, but cult enough that every time I wear it out someone new tells me how much they love it, asks me what it is, and then never heard of it when I tell them.
Its hard to pull off for younger girls becuase it is a very mature scent, but that being said ITS FAR from ""old lady."" Its a great alternative to the ENDLESS patchouli, rose, and oud perfumes on the market (nothing against any of those notes, as I adore them in their place, but the novelty's worn off). Through every fragrance fad of the last eight years, this has remained solidly unique.
Oh yes, and it has a staying power for a full day, which can't be said for many perfumes. On clothing, it wears even longer: I went to a Joan Jett concert a few months ago, and wore a jacket I hardly ever wear, took it out of storage from when I moved out last week AND I COULD STILL SMELL THIS ON IT. I washed it, and it came out, but the fact that its that strong? NICE.
PLUS: the bottle is refillable, and refills are less than a new bottle (good for ur wallet and the planet), and the bottle is this neat futuristic/art-deco design. Would rec for people who like darker scents without the dreaded vanilla undertones; age group 20-50.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,Loveee the smell of this!!! Got a sample a few months ago and it's heavenly. Totally going to pick up a bottle!,5,Sephora,us
Alien,Sooo I think I found my new favorite perfume. Got a small travel size for free using the coupon code and as soon as I smelled it I loved it! Told my boyfriend I want a bottle for Christmas lol,5,Sephora,us
Alien,got this as a small sample,5,Sephora,us
Alien,A little goes a long way.  Strong but not over powering.  Love it.,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I received this as a sample. It is a very nice floral scent that is not to strong but last all day. It is a very different scent I don't normally like floral, but this I love. I will be getting a full size bottle soon.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"Very elegant , muture，unique, different from other perfumes.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,it is such a special parfume!,5,Sephora,us
Alien,Didn't think I would like the smell of this but I really love it.,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"This is my signature fragrance! I searched for over a year, trying a variety of perfumes to find ""my signature"". Then, I found Alien. Everything from the packaging to the scent is perfection. People always compliment me on this scent and ask what I'm wearing but I NEVER tell anyone. I even go so far as to hide my bottle when I'm traveling with friends! It's so delicious I spray it again every night before I go to sleep and I'm dying to buy the matching candles. However, I will say, one of my friends became OBSESSED with finding out what perfume I wear (for over a year). She FINALLY figured it out when she met someone else wearing it. When my friend tried it on herself, she hated it! It really does smell different on everyone.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"My ultimately favorite perfume hands down!  I'm always getting compliments and my husband loves the fact that it does not smell ""floral"".  I can wear this all year.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,too strong &not in a good way. the smell is too much i like clean soft smells . not my type of scent .,1,Sephora,us
Alien,My favorite smell ever! I got a sample of this with one of my orders and was hooked right away. I got so many compliments when I wore it to work. Absolutely amazing smell!,5,Sephora,us
Alien,I love this scent! It's unique and stays long. It became one of my must haves.,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I originally received a sample of this and my husband could not keep his hands off me lol. So naturally I had to buy the full size and it's so worth it. The smell is very unique, I could sniff it out anywhere and know the scent from another fragrance, whereas some of the scents out there are so common and smell like each other.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,This perfume smells delicious! It lasts all day and its smell changes as the day progresses. Its floral notes shine through. Totally recommend for juvenile people!,5,Sephora,us
Alien,This is my favorite perfume if I really want something unique! The scent is hard to describe (I wouldn't label it as floral) but it packs a fun punch and is always the scent that gets me compliments. It's lasting power is unreal. A holy grail for me!,5,Sephora,us
Alien,So far the best perfume i've ever tried. This fragrance is just unique and sexy. Highly recommend it. 24 hour wear for sure!!!!,5,Sephora,us
Alien,Love this. So rich and warm.,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I really want to be able to appreciate all types of perfumes, but this one is so strong that it stings the nose. I can see the simple elegance in many vintage perfumes, heavy but beautiful. This one has some of the same elements as some vintage perfumes I've come across, except this one is the most aggressive scent I've ever smelled. To be honest, it scares me a little.",1,Sephora,us
Alien,"Every time I wear this perfume I get a lot of compliments! 
I just love the smell, I love that it last long ... this is my favorite perfume",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I'm on my 3rd bottle, anyone who thinks this smells bad, guess you're one of those ppl who wears perfumes and it smells off. I mean, how can you argue with 95% of ppl who love it, like me.  I give a light spray after I blow my hair out and my skin and hair smell so amazing, mix that with the alien radiant body lotion...amazing.  I just love this Perfume, it's my go to every time",5,Sephora,us
Alien,I received a sample of this through my play box subscription. I just put a little spritz and I have men stopping me asking what type of perfume it is because it smells so good. You know I'm buying me a full bottle!,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"Everyone I wear this perfume, I receive so many compliments and people always ask me what I am wearing. It smells amazing. Highly recommend.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,Wish I had extra money to spend on this fragrance it is just lovely!,4,Sephora,us
Alien,This is the most unique perfume I've ever smelled.  I get compliments every time I wear it! Lasts all day and I never have to reapply.,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"Received this fragrance in the mail today from my sister- it's nice. The bottle and the scent suit me just fine. Alien is spicy, feminine, unexpected and it lingers. Totally my personality.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"This scent is beautiful. Funny story, a year or so ago I was at Nordstrom and came across this fragrance. I initially thought that the bottle was unique, and was just honestly intrigued. Upon the first spray, I hated it. I was overwhelmed with how strong it was. Later on, I didn't think much of it. All I can say is that the scent lingered on my body for quite some time but did I think about purchasing this product? No.

Later on, as in just a few weeks ago (lol) I received a sample of this with another order. I smelled it again, and fell in love with it this time. It was weird, I couldn't even tell you what changed. Fast forward to yesterday, when I received my 1 oz in the mail. The packaging was beautiful, and I had my first ever Mugler perfume. I showered last night, and smelt the scent in my sleep throughout the night, literally. I woke up this morning, and the scent was still there. Got ready for work, applied vaseline on my wrists and alongside my neck. Now, I am DEEPLY in love with it. I made a Mugler account, and purchased the 3 oz, only because Sephora doesn't carry it. If you're on the fence about this, use it first. Let it sink into your skin. Let it settle in. I promise, you will love it.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"This scent is strange! But not necessarily in a bad way. I've simply never smelled anything like it. This scent somehow manages to smell a little chemically, but almost in a good way - with a floral opening that softens things up. People will notice this fragrance, and it usually lasts all day",4,Sephora,us
Alien,"Same thing I said about the EDT it's a great smell, just give it time to sink into your skin. I feel like this perfume is perfect for any skin chemistry. It well blend well with anyone. Trust me! You have you hand  to  try this perfume! It will last long!!!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,This is legitimately my favorite perfume ever. It lasts all day. It makes me feel powerful and it's my signature scent at this point,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"this perfume smells amazinggg.. i have gotten so many compliments since purchasing just 2 weeks ago! I've already sent many family & friends to purchase as well. such a beautiful, sophisticated scent!! My only complaint is that I ended up buying the travel spray as the spray nozzle on this does not have a way to be covered, so I was worried it would leak in my travels.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,This smell so awful on me. Just not my kind of perfume.,1,Sephora,us
Alien,Love love love new fav,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"If you like the scent, you'll like that it lasts for HOURS. However, the scent was not for me, and it took forever to get it off.",1,Sephora,us
Alien,I received this in my beauty bag and i must say so far this is my fave. It lasts a long time and smells so good.,5,Sephora,us
Alien,I received a free sample of Mugler in my Play by Sephora.  I liked the scent but its not my favorite.  I would wear this maybe on a night out.,4,Sephora,us
Alien,Hands down my favorite perfume! I don't understand how anyone could not like it! I bought the 3 oz bottle so it could last me a while.,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I've tried numerous fragrance samples from Sephora, but I never got complements as much as I did wearing this sample. The scent is very unique and it makes me feel hot, lol. I bought the $50 bottle and I will purchase the refill when it's out.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"Finding a fragrance I love is not easy.  I do not like flowery, sweet, citrusy concoctions.  I also don't like to smell like everyone else.  Since I loathe Angel, I was shocked that I adore Alien.  It goes well with my body chemistry and lasts throughout the day.   Love the scent which is in a word: intoxicating!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I got a sample of this perfume from an Elle Magazine...
At 1st I didn't like it - but then decided to give it a try- my initial reaction was that it smelled like an old perfume I wore in HS - decades ago.. lol... Anais-Anais...
And then I thought it smelled like a clean soapy smell-
I wore it out yesterday & couldn't stop smelling myself... I fell in love with the fragrance -
And I'm a Gourmand Fragrance girl- I love all those musky patchouli fragrances -
However,  this being more floral- I am definitely purchasing a full bottle of this - I think it will pair well with the warmer months....",5,Sephora,us
Alien,This is my go to scent. You need to spray it on yourself and let it sit for 10-15 minutes before you judge as it adjusts to your skin. I always get so many compliments on this and the scent lasts all day! If you get the medium size or larger its refillable at the Bay and Shoppers so you don't have to throw out the bottle and it's slightly cheaper to refill! I use this along with the body wash and bubble bath!!,5,Sephora,us
Alien,Smells sexy and amazing. One of my favorite fragrances.,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"This has been my signature scent since I was 16 (14 years ago).I have been trying for so long to find anything that I would like close enough to switch it up, but I never found anything closely as unique and special as this scent, not even the $400 perfumes that you find at high end perfumers and Barneys!
I get asked at least once a week what am I wearing.
This is the scent that my friends, family and coworkers recognize me by, and they don't want me to find an alternative either!
What can I say,I don't want to promote this too much because I am very protective of it, but at the same time I want as many possible to sell so that it will never be discontinued! 
Thierry,you should send me a few free bottles for how much I have invested in this.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,This perfume matches the scent of my girl's private parts. so i wear this perfume so that anytime i go out and i want to think of my girl i just smell my shirt.,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"This perfume smells amazing.  I recieved a sample of this perfume and fell in love with the scent.  I used the sample bottle so fast that when it was empty I was really missing it.  I normally dont spend a lot on perfume but decided to splurge on this.  Whenever I wear it I recieve so many compliments, which has never happened with any other perfume Ive worn.  I bought a big onr and travel size as well because this will be my forever perfume.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I've always loved dark , heavy scents and when I was introduced to this Fragrance , I didn't fall in love .... I was more so intrigued with the smell. I've never smelled anything like it. It wasn't bad but it wasn't good , either way I couldn't stop smelling me. Needless to say. I bought the rollerball / spray and it has lasted me 2 years ... a little goes a long way. I finally purchased a bottle today :)",4,Sephora,us
Alien,"Alien is this perfume junkie's all-time favorite scent. I find myself reaching for it almost daily, even though it is so sultry, rich, and intoxicating that some may be bothered by it. The staying power is to die for.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"If you don't like heavy or rich scents, this is not for you. It's a beautiful sultry sent that last all day, but is very deep smelling and definitely nothing sweet at all. I love it, I've gone through 2 big bottles!!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,This smells amazing! Definitely my favorite perfume. I receive compliments almost every time I wear it.,5,Sephora,us
Alien,the best.. I wear it all the time and people always say they love it... but I never tell them what i'm wearing... I don't want to share,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"Absolutely awful. Heavy smell that just won't quit. The longevity is real, lol. It smells like potpourri soaked in drugstore cologne. Just no.",1,Sephora,us
Alien,"I've worn this perfume for over five years now, and I don't think I'll ever get tired of it! I've worn several others that while I think are also great, there's nothing quite like Alien. I've never gotten so many compliments on a perfume! It smells so beautiful and unique, and the scent lasts all day. It's well-worth the price tag.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,I get so many compliments when I wear this. You either love alien or angel it seems. Angel has never smelled right on me. But Alien is sultry. Lasts all day long. I spritz it into the air & walk through the mist.,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I don't see why so many people like this perfume! It's not something to rave about in my opinion. It smells like something women from the Marie Antoinette era would wear, I'm more into clean, fresh, floral scents. This is just not for me!!",1,Sephora,us
Alien,I love this perfume so much its my favorite scent as of now i can't get enough of it,5,Sephora,us
Alien,The greatest perfume! I always where Mugler and I always purchase them from Sephora! Alien is my all time favorite!,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I love Mugler Alien! Such a beautiful and soft fragrance that lasts a long time (on your skin of course). It's sexy, pretty and refreshing. At least for me it is! I always loved it and so glad I finally bought it! Definite perfume any women should have in her collection!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I didn't think my faves could ever stray but this is a fine perfume! A little bit goes a long way and when first sprayed, it does kind of feel magical, as corny as that sounds. It's strong enough to make me feel fierce but as the day wears, so does the scent. That would be its only *slight* drawback. Love it!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I really love this smell. Im usually not one to like sweet smells but this one somhow is different and unique enough to like. As the description says, it is a mysertious smell and it is not a very common smell either which is actually what I enjoy about it. I have worn this perfume religiously and have had compliments on it as well. If you dont like the sweet smell maybe the perfume is not for you, however if you want to take a risk for something different and lovely why not try it!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I received a sample of this with an online order and fell in love. The scent it AMAZING! It's also long lasting too. I've got many compliments on it. Eventually I will buy the full size, but it's little more money than I'd like to pay.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I wish I could give this negative stars, I don't understand how so many people like this perfume. It literally smells like cat urine. I tried a sample on myself and nearly gagged from the scent. I immediately went home and showered and I could not get the smell off of me or my scarf for so long. Honestly, at the risk of sounding dramatic it's the grossest most awful perfume I've ever had to smell. So, so, so gross. If you like smelling like an old lady who has too many cats with bladder problems then you'll probably like this perfume.",1,Sephora,us
Alien,When you spray the perfume on your body it's heaven. Everybody can smell you a mile away! Best ever!,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"This has become my absolute favorite! My daughter is now hooked as well. She has teachers ask what it is and I have patients compliment. It lasts, it's unique, and it's re-fillable! I love the unique, warm scent. I am not a fan of too floral. This is just the right blend for any occasion.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,My daughter got me the set for xmas. And I'm in love with this scent. And it's long lasting on my skin. I sprayed tested it in my wrist b4 I took a shower & I can still smell it on my skin after my shower. I'm in love!,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"One of my favorite scents! I get so many compliments on it. Love, love, love.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,This perfume is my soulmate. Now that I have it I no longer have to look for another nor do I want to. This is my signature scent and I couldn't love it more honestly,5,Sephora,us
Alien,I was looking forward to trying but they didnt send to me:( why do they let us pick our own samples and then just send random ones anyway? I base my orders around available samples since i live so far from a sephora. I really wanted to try this one:(,4,Sephora,us
Alien,"I have been wearing this scent for over 5 years, and I cannot say enough good things about it. I ALWAYS get a compliment when I wear it. I have legitimately had several people follow me around stores to try and figure out what it is or ask me what it is with a compliment. I've even got my mom on it, and she hates wearing anything that anyone else she knows wears. It is that good! It's light and floral, but strong enough to last day. I did read a review where someone expected a bottle to last for years, and that is definitely not the case. Mine lasts almost 9-11 months. Then again, that may be because I love it and use it almost every weekday!

There is only one con that I have dealt with several times. The refillable bottle is really only good for one refill. That still saves you like $30, so even that's not too bad.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,This is such a wonderful fragrance.  It is so long lasting.  It is mysterious and everything that is written in the description.,5,Sephora,us
Alien,My very favorite perfume. Love it,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"After my disappointment with Angel I opted to scent Alien next and YES. I got the mini spray as a starter to see if I was willing to shell out money on a refillable bottle. This is definitely a unique fragrance. It's warm, so best to use it during the Fall/Winter, and it's very bold and lingers so don't douse yourself in the stuff. A few sprays at the wrists and neck will suffice. I love this scent and I will be purchasing the refillable bottle next!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"This perfume is incredible, this is the one fragrance I have that I always receive compliments on when I wear it. It's a very sexy scent, and extremely potent as the fragrance lasts throughout the day and into the night. This is definitely a ""night out"" type of scent - it's flirty and energetic, perfect for a date night or just a night out in general!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"This perfume is everything! You def don't need to use much, just one spray on the wrist and then distribute it wherever on your body. It literally lasts ALL DAY. I'm sure one bottle would last for years.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"This is the most richest, concentrated, potent, beautiful, long-lasting fragrance I have ever fell in love with . The notes chosen to create this cannot be any better. I will forever love this fragrance. I get the most compliments. It wears on my skin well. It's the definition of a strong bold fearless woman...  Men are obsessed with it and don't even know why lol",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I loooove this perfume, I smelled on this girl at my old job and I had to ask.
It's crazy how many compliments I get when I wear this, my husband loves it.
I can say it doesn't wear off right away.. it is long lasting.
The only defect is the bottle, sometimes I walk into my room and it smells like Alien, as if it's leaking.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"There's nothing like this scent nothing, period. It's so amazing provocative, strong, deep and unique about Alien. Is this kind os scent that you wouldn't find in other perfume. You love it or you hate it. It's just like this. My favorite perfume ever!! I can't never go without it.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"The custodian at school knows when I am wearing this and compliments me. My students compliment me and fellow teachers, too! Total win!",4,Sephora,us
Alien,First off I would like to say that YouTube influenced me to buy this. The reviews that I watched we're very convincing. When I first opened the fragrance I thought the smell was overwhelming. I gave it a chance and I'm glad that I did. After wearing it the scent changed to fit me. It's sort of addicting. It has a very distinct musk scent that is nostalgic yet unlike anything else.,5,Sephora,us
Alien,This smells amazing!!! Strong sexy powerful. Not for people who like light and fresh. A little goes a long way. I get compliments ALL THE TIME. My husband LOVES it! Stays all day. My signature scent.,5,Sephora,us
Alien,Beautiful smell I love it I can't get enough of it,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"Alien is my favorite perfume. However, I had to return this product 2 times because the bottles were leaking.",3,Sephora,us
Alien,"Very special scent, unlike anything else you will find on the market. Plus, they have the coolest bottle I have even seen.",4,Sephora,us
Alien,"I've only recently gotten into perfume and I was intending to buy a different one, but when I smelled this in the store I ended up buying it without much deliberation. It is never overwhelming but it stays through the entire day without fading much. It's such an odd smell that you want to keep smelling to pinpoint it. very chill and soothing, but intriguing. I end up wearing this every other day, changing it out with various other scents, but this gets picked more than any other perfume for me.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,I have the hardest time finding a yummy fragrance that has staying power.....this fits the bill and more!! The intricate notes and gorgeous bottle are sheer sheer perfection.,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I once received a sample of this months ago and was not that thrilled. Now, I received a sample again and fell in love! I had to order the full-size. This perfume is very unique and the scent is irresistible.
It is very strong, so you don't need that much product and the scent lasts forever!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,I absolutely love this perfume ! I got a sample in a magazine and carried it around with me for months until my boyfriend went and bought it for me because I could not stop talking about it! Such a long lasting unique pleasant smell!,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I adore this perfume. I normally prefer sweet vanilla scents. Like the comptoir Sud pacifique Vanille scents. But i always wanted to step up my perfume game. But most things bother me, give me a headache. This is the first perfume that doesn't smell like vanilla and I love. One spray is enough for me. After about an hour I forget its on, but I know it has longevity because everyone tells me I smell good! And I smell it on my jackets and coats days after. It smells so sexy and mysterious with a little bit of masculinity which I really really like.",2,Sephora,us
Alien,"My mom gifted me this perfume. I always loved the name and packaging, but wasn't sure if it'd be too strong for me, but I LOVE this! It lasts many hours on me (compared to some scents that I have to spray a few times throughout the day) and it smells so ""grown-up"" and sophisticated without smelling like an old lady à la YSL Opium. It's strong enough that I only need three sprays, but not so strong that I'm choking on the scent. It's become my everyday perfume!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"Not a huge fan of perfumes but got this as a sample and I WANT THE FULL SIZED BOTTLE!

Ethereal! <3",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"This bad boy is truly one of a kind, something that's so exotic and completely different than anything that I have come across. It's the most seductive, irresistible, long lasting perfume that I have owned. I sprayed it on neck and my jacket and 3 days later I could still smell it on my clothes.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,I absolutely love this!,5,Sephora,us
Alien,I received so many complements on this lovely fragrance. I wil DEFINITELY purchase again.,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I do not understand the hype of this perfume. To me it smells a little cheap. Not bad, but not particularly amazing. It's a good fragrance for going out at night. Not offensive, just not beautiful. Kind of synthetic. I have the small refill version for trips where I think I'll be going out a lot or to take out with me if I bring a bigger purse. Also, it's cute.",3,Sephora,us
Alien,I love this perfume. It is a strong unique scent that lasts all day. This is my new go to scent and I've gotten so many compliments.,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"After coveting this fragrance for over a year I finally purchased yesterday!! This scent is in a league of its own. No other scent out there smells quite like it. It's strong, bold and exquisite. I feel like if I use words to describe it I'll miss the mark haha to my nose it smells like orange blossom and jasmine with a woodsy mid note and a musky powdery base but others may read this and say I've got it all wrong! Because this scent is so complex and unique. It has such long staying power and that's crucial to me because of I'm paying a high price point on Eau de Parfum I want to smell it all day. This doesn't disappoint!!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I sampled this fragrance in a department store when looking for a signature fragrance. I've always gone for the scents like Pleasures, Romance, Aqua Di Gio, Light Blue, and Clinique Happy. These scents are great on me and I love the way I smell. However, when I began wearing Alien all the other scents went unused. People always complimented me on my scent. I have a gentleman to follow me through the store while he built up the nerve to ask me what I was wearing. This is my new signature scent for the evening or anytime I'm feeling sexy. I love this fragrance and will always have it in my collection.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"First I'd like to say that I am a perfume junkie. I have so many different perfumes but this one right here has drawn the most compliments. It is strong at first, but the dry down is amazing! it lasts extremely long and has a strong sillage. Very unique scent, a little goes a long way!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"My previous fragrance was Armani Code and this is a wonderful step UP.

This fragrance is sexy. A wonderful blend of sweet and spice.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"A beautiful and complex fragrance, this is definitely not a cheap smelling generic scent. It's my new signature scent!
The only complaint I have and the reason for only 4 stars is that I bought the 2 oz refill bottle and the bottle was NOTHING like what what pictured on the website :(",4,Sephora,us
Alien,"First a word on those stupid uneducated uncultured ignorant young millennials for whom any quality perfume is old ladyish, they probably wear BO-RING generic white florals for dumb little girls that are not distinctive!
Alien is a beautiful woody floral, sensual and complex. Lots of compliments!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I'm usually more into light and fruity scents, but when I got a sample of this gem in a beauty box, I was hooked. It smells so warm and inviting, definitely on the more intense stronger side, but just put a little bit and it'll last all day. I don't agree with other reviews that it smells ""old lady"". shoot if any old lady is wearing this scent, she has it going on! I think because it's more intense and has that warmer smell, that may be why some say that, but I'm 32, and wear everything from Prada Candy, YSL Opium, etc. and this is now one of my new staple scents.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I absolutely this fragrance. It's soft and light, but you can definitely build by spraying a bit more. I find it can be overpowering if you spray more than 2-3 sprays.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"This perfume is so overwhelming and gave me the hugest headache (and I'm not particularly sensitive to perfumes). Not to mention, I smelled like an old lady at the market on a Sunday afternoon. I put my sample in the garbage and literally the smell is dispersing from the actual bin as I type this.",1,Sephora,us
Alien,"I got a sample of this and I loved it, had to order full size. I'm not huge into perfume and have used the same one for years now, happy to have found a new sent. Will be buying over and over.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"The scent is overwhelming, seems nice at first ends up smelling old lady ish.",1,Sephora,us
Alien,"This perfume is NOT for the faint of heart. Its a true radiant mysterious femme fatale that lives and breathes magic. She demands attention but in a subtle magical way. Longevity six hours or so, great silliage! Mugler at his finest. I compare this perfume to something of a stoic enchantress, like Maleficent. She truely casts a spell...a lovely jasmine shrouded in a unique alien aura",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I tried a sample of this and loved it. To me, it smelled light and airy but substantial and slightly sweet at the same time - I can't quite explain it. I would recommend getting a sample in store, since some have said it's too strong. I have trouble with some perfumes irritating my nose and throat but not with this one. Personally, I wish I could splurge and buy a big bottle right now!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"Wow - got this as a sample and have seen it so often, I figured I would love it. I wear a lot of different perfumes - I love heavy fragrances, but this one? Oy. This one was crazy strong and unbearable. I do get migraines, not usually from perfume (but have food triggers) - for the first time, I could feel one coming on almost immediately. I had to scrub it off quickly - but even then, I could still smell it.",1,Sephora,us
Alien,OMG! This is the best perfume I brought in long time...brought the refillable bottle can't wait to wear it...,5,Sephora,us
Alien,I got this as a sample and when I wore the fragranceI fell in love with it. It is nothing like anything other perfumes that I have. I would recommend this fragrance to anyone who is willing to try this intriguing perfume.,5,Sephora,us
Alien,Very overpowering I ended up dumping the sample down the drain. Gives me a headache every time I smell it.,1,Sephora,us
Alien,It is amazing for what it's worth. It's definitely more for the fall and winter Bc it's heavy but also very unique. I get a of of compliments from guys. It lasts a long time. Sometimes it makes my sinuses work up but I'm just very sensitive to perfumes. Buy it.,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I love fragrance and have been through hundreds over the years- always changing. Well I am hooked and addicted to this one. I actually put it on every evening after my shower and every morning. I never have used perfume regularly/daily before. I just find that I want to smell like Alien all of the time. Also, my husband and son love it and it lasts a long time. If it is ever discontinued, I will lock myself in the bathroom and cry for days (after stockpiling whatever I can find that is left).",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I received this as a sample and omg! It smells awesome. It's definitely a stronger scent, but I really like that. You honestly only need one spray. I feel like the 2oz bottle will last quite a while. It's a bit on the pricey side, but it's so worth it. I'll definitely be purchasing a bottle of this. Makes me feel sophisticated, beautiful, and fancy. Love!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I love this perfume sooo very much, it has such a rich and beautiful notes to it. I feel absolutely luxurious wearing it. And always get compliments",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"This smells great but it's kind of odd when you first smell it and I can't quite place what it is but that fades away into a mostly jasmine and amber scent soon. If you don't like jasmine, don't try this. If you want to know what a jasmine perfume smells like I would give this a spray! It smells gorgeous but different than mainstream perfumes in my opinion. Definitely warm and super long lasting.",4,Sephora,us
Alien,"Upon reading the description the following notes are in this fragrance Solar Accord, Jasmine Sambac, Green Notes, Cashmeran, Vanilla, Transparent Amber.I received this fragrance as a sample and I have to say I love it. I'm usually leaning towards the sweeter fragrances. IT does have long lasting notes. I would say it's comparable to Flower Bomb if your fan try it out.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,just overwhelming ugh.,1,Sephora,us
Alien,"I received this as a sample...I was never crazy about Angel, but this...it smells so sexy on.  Even though it has an amber note, the jasmine keeps it light enough for summer.   I noticed it has excellent staying power as well. I am definitely getting a full size...definitely a pleasant surprise.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"If you do NOT like patchouli, chances are you will not like this perfume. I love it, it's very strong and androgynous without being too manly. Very earthy tones but not as floral and light as I usually prefer but still a keeper for late night. Has this strange middle note that's kind of ""hypnotic"".",4,Sephora,us
Alien,"I received this as a sample, and it's one of the worst perfumes I've ever smelled. Even my husband agreed, and I had to scrub my wrists multiple times to get the scent off (even though I only spritzed one tiny spray!). I really don't recommend this, the scent is overpowering.",1,Sephora,us
Alien,Simply the best. Has unique scent that lasts for days. I just love it.,5,Sephora,us
Alien,My mother bought me a sampler pack a while ago and this was a scent in it. It is amazing. People always comment about how much they love it.,5,Sephora,us
Alien,AWFUL!!!!! I had to scrub this stuff off my wrists 3 times to get the stench out! Too much tuberose and pepper and god knows what else. Very strong and gave me a headache and made me nauseous. I really do not know why some people llike this.,1,Sephora,us
Alien,"Behind the friendly florals lies a strangely acrid note that's not unpleasant, because it blends and adds character to an otherwise commonplace scent. I'd call it a metallic floral. My SO said from a distance it smells like tomatoes and catbox ""in a good way"", and up close smells ""awesome."" I find it quite wearable.",4,Sephora,us
Alien,Such a fresh and clean smell!,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I bought this accidentally. I smelled a very pretty perfume on a woman and asked what it was called because she smelled like a spicy vanilla. She said Alien. I memorized it and then quickly went on Sephora to buy it for my mom for Mother's Day. Nope! This wasn't what I smelled on her. Turns out there are multiple Aliens! 

Alien Original: my take on it is this...starts on like a heavy floral, I smell roses, a touch powdery, it's mature. Then the dry down which doesn't take too long to reach, it is a much more approachable floral with a bit of musk in there. I like it. One spray on the wrist, rub them together done. My 14 yr. old son however after I initially spray it says, ""What the heck is that smell?"" Then proceeds to hide his nose in his shirt. So this scent is not for the faint of heart.

Alien Essence Absolue: This is the spicy vanilla. I prefer this one personally and my mom indeed loved it! I'm guessing this is the one I smelled on that woman in the parking lot.",4,Sephora,us
Alien,"I got a sample of this perfume when I bought my mom the Angel gift set and I fell in love with it.  It's not your typical flowery and sugary perfume, rather it is woodsy with a slight hint of floral.  I've never smelled a perfume quite like this, it's a very refined smell that is unique.  I find that it is my go to perfume year round rather than the perfume that I had been using previously (Marc Jacobs Daisy) which was very flowery and summery.  I feel that this is more of a sensual perfume.  When I finally got a full size I loved the bottle (so pretty) and the fact that it is refillable.  Also the scent lasts all day while not being overpowering which is great.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,I absolutely love this scent. I tried this initially from a sampler set and fell in love. I get compliments all the time wearing this scent. It smells so wonderful ..soooo wonderful. it lasts a long time without being overwhelming.,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I brought the Sephora Favorites Deluxe Perfume sampler, looking for a different perfume, when I cashed in the certificate I was told I had to pick a perfume that was in the sample. 
I like Thirey Mugler but I love his Angel perfume and had to settle for Alien instead",3,Sephora,us
Alien,I got this as a sample and fell in love. This is my spring/summer go to. Love it.,5,Sephora,us
Alien,My absolute favourite perfume. People always comment on it and ask what I'm wearing. I LOVE it!!!!!,5,Sephora,us
Alien,One of my top favorite fragrance my husband loves it :),4,Sephora,us
Alien,"I purchased the Divine limited edition gold flecked bottle at the Sephora in Holyoke, MA. I first smelled it in a sample from a Sephora.com order and loved it so much I lusted after it and used my sample spray only a few special times until I decided to buy the 2mL refillable version. The most amazing scent. My mother, aunt, and sister, all very different and lovely ladies, adore this scent. My fiance loves it on my skin too. I didn't know it at the time but the bottle I bought is different, the scent inside is the real deal though. The plain bottle looks like a soul gem from Elder Scrolls. I love the design so much. The one I purchased is a LE version called ""Divine"" and that it is. A purple glass gem covered in flecks of gold. Really pretty and glad it can be refilled.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,This smells so goodit does not have any alcohol sent and it and it lasted a very long time even after you wash your clothes or take a shower.,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"This is a totally good smelling male perfume, yes male perfume. It is too manly smelling for me to wear myself but on him it smells great. He loves it too. He wears it daily and he gets complimented on it frequently. He is a more feminine and comfortable with himself type man. He doesn't like traditional male musk smells as they bother his allergies. This didn't bother him at all. He wears this and Lady Gaga. I would buy it for him again!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"After lusting for over a year I finally purchased this perfume and it is everything I could have hoped for. The scent stays on my clothes for a full day so it is very long wearing! It is not too strong though which I really like because strangers 50 feet away won't be smelling me. The smell itself is unique and it is a sweet woodsy floral combination. I would try this out if you're looking for something other than your typical floral, musk, or linen smell!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"Just because a fragrance isn't sugary sweet, doesn't mean it's masculine. ;)
Alien is sensual and grown-up. It's mysterious and beautiful. Memorable. Unique. The silage is very good and the lasting power.... well, it's a Mugler! It lasts forever and is top quality. It has a ""je ne sais quois"" that's missing in many moder perfumes.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"This is a very masculine scent. It is very strong and overpowering. It is also very peppery and it hurts my chest when I smell it. This is horrible. I hate it. It is way too strong, dark, masculine for me. It smells like something your grandma would wear sort of like Elizabeth Taylor perfumes. If you remember those sort of perfumes like white diamonds, it is very similar to this. I would never buy this in a million years. Horrible. Makes my head hurt. Horrible. Horrible.",1,Sephora,us
Alien,This is the only perfume I've ever repurchased. It literally lasts all day and it will last DAYS on clothing. I get so many compliments on this and I've had men ask me what perfume it is so they can get it for their SO. I will always own Alien!,5,Sephora,us
Alien,This sent is amazingly beautiful. It seems to smell better on clothes then on the skin but it stays for days and definitely leaves an everlasting impression. I get the most compliments and questions when I wear this perfume. It seems like it's not for everyone but it's definitely worth a try.,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"Words cannot begin to describe my love for this fragrance. It's a rich, sophisticated scent that literally lasts all day. It's expensive, but it's worth every penny. And the best part is that you can refill it when your bottle is empty. Five stars all the way.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I want ittttt, smellllss gorgeous",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I really cannot describe Alien in an appropriate manner that would do it justice. You will have to experience the perfume for yourself. If you love woodsy, cashmere type scents, then you'll absolutely love this. It's warm yet vibrantly cool at the same time with a hint of a powdery floral. The youthful, sophisticated and out of this world fragrance with a slight duality promises to captivate the senses. Alien polarizes both the feminine and masculine energies",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"Such. Beautiful, sensual fragrance. You don't need to spray a lot, and it lasts a long time. Glad I finally have this.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,It lasts all day with only one spray. People always ask what I'm wearing. It is an absolute must have for me.,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"Alien is my comfort scent. On me it has a big opening and then, throughout the drydown, wears somewhat close to the skin. The jasmine is very warm and melds wonderfully with the amber. I'm not sure what the other notes are I smell in this, but it gives an impression of golden afternoon indolence. The 'solar goddess' of the ad copy is a great mental image.

Also, Alien's longevity is fantastic-- one spray on the back of my neck is enough for me to still smell it in my hair next morning. However, I like it wafting around me in a cloud of radiance, so I usually add two sprays along my decolletage. ;)

If I had a signature scent, this would be it. Alien is perfection.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"Every time I wear this I constantly get asked, ""what perfume is that?!"" It's long lasting - like really long lasting, so a little goes a long way. It's such a different scent but so lovely. I can't even count how many bottles I've purchased haha",5,Sephora,us
Alien,Literally one of my favorites next to Jadore!,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"This perfume came in a magazine in an actual sample a few times for me. At first I was disgusted and overwhelmed and threw it away. The second time I was like wow this is actually pretty good and used it. Then I decided to buy it and boy am I glad! I was using Dolce & Gabana Light Blue only and it was worn out. I am tired of the scent and it never lasts. This lasts all day with only one or two sprays. Do yourself and everyone around you a favor and do NOT spray more than 2 pumps. I'm warning you, it will be a headache for everyone and you will hate it! I made that mistake the first time I wore it! But I am now in love and get compliments everywhere I go. Since it is a perfume, you get a lot more use out of it too. I used to spray D&C 3+ times and never have this effect. Buy it you won't be disappointed!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"This is one of the few fragrances that actually lasts all day on my clothing and on my skin. It's a gorgeous scent, never sexy and sultry. It's a little strong but smelling it every time I flip my hair makes me feel so confident :) totally worth the money",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"Gave me a headache!
It did not work for me...Very strong.",1,Sephora,us
Alien,This new fragrance is amazing! I've gotten so many compliments on the unique and intoxicating scent. My new favorite next to Angel of course :),5,Sephora,us
Alien,Love the scent of this perfume..Smells elegant.. This is my second favorite perfume,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I have always been a scent-aholic since I was young. I have loved many different fragrances. Non quite the way I love this.
I was honestly concerned from some of the reviews of this product... Grandma smell? Maybe if your grandma was young, smoldering, and her milkshake brought all the boys to the yard!
The details: even at first spray I found it intoxicating. Not the weird overbearing scent some have described. When I went in and tested I was immediately hooked. I had the associate set the bottle behind the counter as I finished my Seohora shopping experience.
I sprayed it on myself around 11 a.m. It is now 4 p.m. I only spritzed one tiny squirt onto my wrist, dabbing onto the other while dabbing onto my neck. I smelled the spice, the floral, the dark undertones immediately with that hint of amber... Which has now become more prominent as it has settled. Less spice, but still noticeable with a nice dose of amber.
I find nothing ""old"" about this selection. I find it bold, sexy, and I keep wanting to sniff my wrists.. It's becoming an issue.
I am a career woman in very early 30's and this scent feels mature, powerful, and above all else like a fox. I was turning heads out of the mall and the car ride home with the heat vents blowing continued to waft the scent through the air. It was like heaven.
I would never tell anyone to go buy a perfume based on my experience alone. We all have different scent profiles and our chemistry adheres to certain notes. Be sure you try this on your wrist at the store before deciding. Start with the spritz and continue to shop so you can get more of the profile.
It may be considered a bit pricey to some, but I think it's just right.. Especially considering the bottle is refillable and the refills will not cost as much as the initial purchase. This is also not a scent you should over indulge on- too much I feel would be enough to put people off. Therefore, a bottle of this will get you much farther than lesser cost fragrances that don't have this staying power.
My advice? If you like fresh light teeny bop happy airy fragrances, this probably won't be your favorite thing. 16 year old me was a Clinique Happy girl all the way.. I would like to think I graduated to a more mature scent profile ;)",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"Initially I received a sample and was kind of over whelmed with the scent at first. It's not one to just fade away with time it stays on all day. It is a very unique strong and sexy scent and one that I would normally not have gravitated towards, but through out the day I would notice I was trying to get whiffs of it while I was wearing it. Men also seem to like it because I have had 4 give me compliments on separate occasions. My only advice would be to wear it a little lighter than you would a normal perfume because it is a little strong. Over all I love it and it is my favorite perfume. Packaging is remarkable and will be traveling with this beauty soon.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"When I initially smelled Alien on a tester strip, I didn't really like it. I thought it smelled ""old"" - as I've heard from a lot of non-fans - and flat. I still grabbed a sample because the one person I knew who loved it had similar perfume tastes and I didn't think she'd steer me wrong. It took me a while to finally wear it, but within an hour of putting it on, I knew I'd have to buy it. This is one of those scents that really needs body chemistry to work (which is why I think there are such strong reactions to it) and I am so grateful for the way it works with mine. It smells warm and vanilla-y with a hint of floral. It's strong, but not overwhelming, and it's definitely the most adult scent I've ever owned. My wife also loves it on me and rarely comments on anything I wear unless I'm asking for her opinion. She goes out of her way to sniff me when I wear this and that's definitely worth five stars!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"Received a sample of this product and i absolutely loved it. I went to get my brows done and she complemented my perfume. I don't think i have every had that happen before. It works perfectly with my body chemicals, so i definitely getting a sample to see if it works for you. I'm definitely buying the full size next. I suppose the only downside is that is doesn't last the whole day for me. Maybe half the day and then i spritz a bit again, but i don't really mind too much.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,The best smelling perfume I've ever had!!,5,Sephora,us
Alien,Such a beautiful signature scent. Every time I wear this perfume Men stop me and ask what is it I'm wearing. This is a perfume I will never be without.,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"There is something about this smell that is just so intoxicating. I didn't like it that much at first but after wearing it all day, I became totally hooked. I even had to spray it onto my pillow before bed.

I'm not great as describing scents, but this one is just perfect IMO. It's feminine without being too sweet. Floral but soft. I just love the smell so, so much.

At first the smell is quite strong and floral, but it fades wonderfully to a much warmer, musky vanilla. It lasts all day.

Will definitely be purchasing the larger bottle.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I got a sample of this in my last order. When I first sprayed it on it smelled like something your great grandmother would have worn, but I thought I'd give it a chance. After wearing it for 4 hours I still don't like it, though the scent is now a little softer. So glad we can get samples to find out what we like!",1,Sephora,us
Alien,I chose this as one of my free samples at checkout and it seemed fun so I was excited about it. I didn't like the scent at all. It was way t0o strong and had a very chemical smell to me. It kind of reminded of me of the way bug spray smells. It tickled my nose and just made me feel uncomfortable.,2,Sephora,us
Alien,"This perfume smells a little too much for like 15 minutes, but it has great smell after that. It is long standing and everybody loves the smell, starting from my 17 year old sister ending with my 75 year grandma",5,Sephora,us
Alien,I Got This For Christmas And Im Almost Out Ive Always Had A Hard Time Having Purdumes Stay I Spray This On Me In The Morning And At The End Of The Day Have People Walk Up To Me And Ask Me If Im Wearing Alien I Can Never Smell It On Me But Everyone Around Me Says They Can And Its Not Harsh I Think I Found The Perfume For Me I Will Have A Hard Time Buying Any Other Kind Even After I Smoke Its Still There It Is Expensive But Totally Worth It I Will Definitely Be Purchasing Again I Truly Love It,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"i wasn't particularly thrilled with this scent, but thats solely due to my individual preference. It started out sensuous but ended a little sour for my taste. Everyones chemistry is way different!",3,Sephora,us
Alien,"Alien is one of the most amazing scents, that I have ever worn! It captures you and anyone who catches a whiff of you. I receive so many compliments on it! I also love to layer the Alien fragrance with the body wash, body cream, body lotion, & perfume! Ah!!! :)",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I had never heard of this perfume before until I got in the elevator with a lady that smelled amazing! I asked her what she was wearing and she said ""alien."" I immediately went and bought it and have loved it ever since! I have gotten more compliments on it!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"This fragrance is light but packed with interesting and alluring notes. It has staying power and with its stay power is stays fresh, never turns too sweet or sour. I love this scent!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,Got This perfume as a Christmas present. I just love it!!,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I originally bought another item offline and earned three free samples, I got this as a sample. I immediately fell in love with it and went back online to purchase a bigger size. It's not your typical fruity, flowery young women scent but there's something dark and mysterious about it. It's now my daily wear!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I got the free sample, but goshhhh, I love this scent so much ! Just smelling it alone puts me in a great mood ! It's potent, so a couple sprays goes a long way!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"Great fragrance , unlike anything else",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"My darling husband bought the Christmas time perfume sampler for me as a gift, and as I made my way through it I was sorely disappointed. One boring and overwhelming floral after another. Then I came across this gem. On me, Alien is a complex mix of powdery, spicy, and just a touch floral. It kind of reminds me of a grown-up version of Love's Baby Soft. The scent held up all day and didn't give me a headache. Not sure if I'll redeem my certificate for it, but I'll definitely add it to my ""to watch"" list.",4,Sephora,us
Alien,That's the only word to describe it: Amazing!,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"This perfume is heaven in a bottle. It is super sweet and vanilla-y, yet mysteriously dark. While I think that it could be worn everyday, I feel like I'll wear it mostly for nights out. Even though I don't plan to wear it very often, I still think that it's worth having as an option. It's that good.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"You will receive endless compliments. Wonderful smell that lasts. Classic yet youthful, one of my favourite scents ... ever.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,This perfume smells amazing. Long lasting. I received a lot of compliments. Love it.,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I received a sample and fell in love! I immediately went to my nearest Sephora store to buy a bottle. From the time it took to leave Sephora and return to my car, I received three compliments. A little goes a long way and it really lasts. This is definitely a new favorite!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"This perfume is amazing. All you need is a quick spray and it truly lasts all day and all night. Its strong, yet still sexy and feminine. It is a very unique scent. It's hard to describe, but if you love floral scents warmed by vanilla and amber, you'll probably love Alien.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"This is a perfect perfume. Honestly better than my Chanel perfumes by far... It has a scent of slightly more masculine than other perfumes although it kind of gives you that mature vibe rather than manly vibe. (don't worry, you won't smell like a man wearing this perfume)
My friend had this perfume and at first I hadn't liked it because I was younger and used to the sweet smelling perfumes but now that I'm a little bit older I've grown to like it a lot now. It's my favorite perfume in my collection.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I've had so many perfumes, but this one is by far my favorite. The smell is strong and lasts for days, I love it.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"Next to Tom Ford Noir Pour Femme, this is hands down one of my all time favorite perfumes. It smells absolutely amazing! You can use it sparingly and the scent lasts. I received compliments from several guys on this perfume. Worth checking out!",4,Sephora,us
Alien,I have been wearing this perfume for a few years now and every day not only do people tell me I smell great but then want to know exactly what I'm wearing so that they go check it out too. A few friends went out and bought it after smelling it on me. It hooks people immediately and everyone wants to go out and get it. It's just a winner and an unforgettable fragrance that will make people remember you just because you smell so incredible.,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"Strong, floral while having a really warm and deep scent. Slightly masculine, but still sweet. It's really tough to describe but it's so amazing!!

Thierry Mugler fragrances should almost come with a warning that you need to try them on your skin before you purchase though. I highly recommend going to a store, trying it and seeing how it wears after a few hours. The smell changes based on your body chemistry and becomes something totally different by the time you're ready to wash it off. It smells very different on me, than it does on my sister who hated it.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I love the fragrance and when I received the sample it was wonderful, stayed on forever. The full size one that I bought isn't like the sample at all. The fragrance is gone in about 1/2 hour. Maybe I got a bad one, but I won't be ordering this again",1,Sephora,us
Alien,Glorious scent! Should be worn sparingly. Excellent lasting fragrance..,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I've been looking for my signature scent and the other day at Macy's I stumbled across this bad boy. Omg it smells so good, it literally smells like real life flowers. Not like an artificial one but like when you lean in to a garden flower. It's so beautiful!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"This is my absolute favorite perfume! I've never been big on fragrances, but I can't get enough of this one! Every time that I put it on, I receive constant compliments from both men and women. The scent lasts all day and a little bit goes a long way.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,I went to a party when I wore this for the first time. Most of the people I met complimented me on how good I smell! And it is definitely long-lasting; the smell was still there even when I got home about 7 hours after. Will def repurchase this!,5,Sephora,us
Alien,I wear this everyday and I get a lot of compliments on how good I smell all the time!! I definitely recommend - get it!!!,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"After three years of hunting for my signature scent (and so, so many Sephora samples), I've officially found it. There is no other perfume quite like Alien, and every morning I put it on, I'm still getting compliments by the time I pick up my lunch. I can definitely smell the jasmine - highly recommend for anyone who likes feminine scents with an air of mystery. I found that every other perfume I've tried doesn't leave an impression like this one.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,I used to work at Sephora. And out of all of the perfumes I could choose to wear. I chose this one 9/10 times =],5,Sephora,us
Alien,I love this perfume. It's very unique and it is not overpowering. It's also great that the bottles are refillable.,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"This perfume smells amazing, once it dries. However, it does not last long. For $165. it better last... and it doesn't so it's going back.",2,Sephora,us
Alien,"Received a small sample of this perfume free with my last Sephora order, and I love it SO MUCH. I can't really describe the scent, but it's rich and musky in a super feminine way that's hard to forget.
If you are looking for an alluring new signature scent, this just might be it. Would highly recommend.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"This is a deep, sweet scent with some mystery to it because it doesn't smell like anything else! It also has great lasting power, I can still smell it at the end of the day. I bought the travel size spray and talked myself into ordering the full size today during the VIB Rouge sale.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"So unusual and unique! I've been on the fence about it, but I've decided I need to buy the full size. One of my favorite scents!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I'm not sure that I like this scent, compared to Angel, but I don't hate it either. It's a very funky smell, but in a good way. It's a little sweeter, at least on me, and that's not usually what I go for. But this is a great perfume and I'm glad I've experienced it.",4,Sephora,us
Alien,"It's so hard for me to choose between Alien and Angel, but they are very different. Alien is the slightly sexier, more provocative version. This is meant to be worn on a date or clubbing, not so much in the office. This is my go-to perfume if I want to feel sexy, and definitely for those who love unique and exotic, slightly musky scents.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,This is most most wonderful smelling! I could smell it all day long!!,5,Sephora,us
Alien,So obsessed with this perfume. It is so long lasting! I forgot I sprayed my coat last season- and now that it's cold again- I am wearing my coat and people are asking me what I am wearing-- that's how long it lasts. It is the best smelling perfume- men love it and women as well. I always get so many compliments. I cannot imagine wearing anything else!,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"Theoretically, this perfume has all the ingredients that would make me love wearing it... then I sprayed it and wasn't sure at all. I love vanillas and musks but the scent smelled somewhat heady and flowery at first... but... as soon as the first notes dissipated a sensual musky sweet scent remained and I was sold!!! I wore it a few times to be sure (asked for a sample!) and I just adored being surrounded by the alluring sweet scent... I ordered it and can't wait to receive it. I'm pretty sure this will be my go-to scent for a very long time and it's not too expensive... (I also wear Seven Veils by Byredo)...",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"A very nice perfume that has a soft musky scent, but the scent does not last more than 4 hours on me. I have sprayed it twice on me to make the scent last longer and it is gone by the afternoon.",3,Sephora,us
Alien,"my fav perfume ever, and guys dig it too ;)",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I got a sample in a magazine I receive and could not stop smelling it the second I sprayed it on me. I went out to buy it the next day! People say it smell like a grandma perfume... maybe for a quick second when you first spray, but oh my as soon as its on it just smells SOOOOO good! Love this perfume. I do feel it lasts quite a while too and the smell does just keep getting better! Love this!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I absolutely love the scent! Everyone stops to ask me what I'm wearing.
The more it stays on throughout the day, the better the scent gets",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I am in love with this perfume. One spray goes a long way, lasts all day!

Grandma smell??? not on your life!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,Love this scent. Lingers all day and dries very crisp and deep.,4,Sephora,us
Alien,I have been using this for years and I am in love. It is my signature scent. You know its good when you get compliments from strangers on the train asking what are you wearing?? It is VERY long lasting. My fave is spraying it on scarfs and jackets the smell will linger for so longgg. It's a very unique smell and I definitely recommend it,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"My go to. This scent is amazing and truly mysterious and ""alien"" like. Unlike any other typical fragrance. Goes on warm/sweet but settles into a clean feminine scent. It's a strong scent and it last all day. I feel like people who don't understand this fragrance lack an advanced scent palate (aka the people who call it a grandma smell). I find it to be a great scent for women of all ages. I consider it a sexy scent for a professional. strong, confident woman. Try it out!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"Best fragrance I have ever owned, I get so many compliments on it and people asking what it is. And everyone is surprised by the name which makes them want it even more. Lasts all day for sure, I put it on in the morning and still get compliments way late into the night. I hope it stays around forever because it is absolutely my favorite!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I absolutely hate this fragrance. For about 20 minutes or so, anyway, then we hit the mid-notes and it's absolutely wonderful. The dry-down rocks, too. But OY those first 20 minutes or so are really hard to take. And my little dog agrees (sneeze snort cough wretch) (she's a drama queen).",3,Sephora,us
Alien,One spray of this and it lasts all day. Its so unique and i always receive compliments. ive been wearing it for 7 years and never get tired of it,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"This is the BEST perfume hands down. Before this I was in love with Gucci Guilty but Alien has taken its place. Ive been wearing this for about a year or so and get compliments daily. The only thing is the packaging. I own 2 large bottles eventhough they are refillable (I thought my first bottle was defective) and a smaller bottle. The 2 large bottles over some time get a sticky gummy film that doesnt allow you to depress the nozzle, its stuck..I have not had a problem with the smaller bottle yet and it has been a couple months",4,Sephora,us
Alien,"Have only been wearing for a couple of days but already one of the best perfumes I've owned. not shocking when smelled, but it lingers and leaves a delicious sent",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"No, but this is easily the best perfume I have EVERY owned. I usually buy three at a time and switch them up, but guess who is repurchasing over and over..THIS GIRL.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"It took me a while to get on board with the Thierry Mugler fragrance line. Then I received a sample of Angel not to long ago and decided to give it another shot. Soft, feminine beauty! I also received a sample of Alien -- it is such a unique fragrance, plays very well with my body chemistry and I get compliments EVERYWHERE! Men and women alike. I just smile and say ""thank you""! So I'm going to pay it forward, and smile :) and say, Thank you Thierry Mugler for giving us such unique fragrances in a world where everything smells alike...",5,Sephora,us
Alien,Most scents give me a headache so I can't wear them but I got this as a sample and absolutely am in love. It works well with my skin and it does last all day. You can pick out someone wearing it In a room. It's worth a try to go to a store and sample it because it is rather expensive!,5,Sephora,us
Alien,This is not a fragrance for everybody. It is very strong and a bold perfume. It certainly makes a statement in a room. It is a jasmin explosion but a very good one in my opinion. Totally in love with this scent.,5,Sephora,us
Alien,This fragrance has become my absolute favorite! Everywhere I go people want to know what I am wearing. It makes me feel gorgeous!,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"Love, Love, Love. Hawaiian Escape in a bottle. The Sun, the jasmine, it's fantastic and lasts FOREVER. One spritz is all you need so definitely worth it. Perfect for daytime at the office and nights out.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,I love how this perfume smells on me! I originally received it as a sample and I tried out for a day. I got so many compliments on it that I bought the full size bottle. The scent last all day long and you only need a couple of sprays.,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"it's a nice scent, my 9 year old loves it. I ended up giving to her because it smelled too sweet on me.",3,Sephora,us
Alien,"If you could capture the essence of nature in a bottle, it would smell like alien. I am addicted to this scent. It empowers me and I am more confident and aggressive when wearing this. Give it a chance!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"It's unique upfront, but dries down to a sweet powdery scent. If you don't like powdery scents you might want to avoid.",3,Sephora,us
Alien,"This scent is so unique and has a lot of depth. I see complaints of it being powdery and I agree, but it doesn't bother me much. A little goes a long way and I get tons of compliments. The scent stays with me all day. I find one squirt is enough, which makes me feel better about the price!",4,Sephora,us
Alien,"it doesn't smell bad, or excellent, i'd say it just average, mostly flowery and then it turns sweet.",3,Sephora,us
Alien,For a 2 oz. Bottle its $70 on his website.. Just looking out!,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"Oh man, I got a sample of this and it is one of the most heavenly scents I've ever tried!!! Its sexy and floral and perfect!!!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I just tried out a sample I recently got, and it's a very interesting scent. It's unique! Sweet and a little powdery. It is a very strong scent, which would not be great for every occasion, but I like it.",4,Sephora,us
Alien,"This perfume is not as much drama as the reviews indicate. It's not necessarily similar to any other specific perfume I can think of but for me it was not particularly strong, unique, or long lasting. it was sweet and seemed to have depth.",4,Sephora,us
Alien,I was surprised to find that I love this fragrance. It is very unique and multi layered. It's not for everyone so get a sample! I've worn it to work for a few days now and received many compliments.,4,Sephora,us
Alien,"This fragrance is unique, there's no doubt about that. It is super strong, so I would advise anyone who wears it to use it very sparingly. The woody notes are what's most noticeable, but you can also detect a light, sweet, powdery smell on top of that. You can smell the very strong amber as well. I just don't care for this fragrance. I don't think the ingredients mix well together. And ever since I put it on, I've been trying to wash it off--it's cloying, not ""soothing."" And it lasts for many hours; at least four or five hours. So I would advise anyone to sample this fragrance before buying it to see if you like it and it works with your body chemistry.",2,Sephora,us
Alien,"My brother's GF was wearing this perfume at dinner one night and I was so obsessed that I went out and bought it the next day.

The key to Alien is moderation. It is VERY strong. I always spray one spritz in front of me and walk through it so it's not overwhelming. Even when I do this, the fragrance lasts all day...my room still smells like it after +12 hours. One time I made the mistake of spraying myself when I was driving and I felt like I could be smelled miles away...let's just say I did not let that happen again. The initial smell is...different, but the dry down is absolutely intoxicating. It smells sweet yet woody. I think this is supposed to be more of an evening fragrance, but I say ""screw it"" and still wear it to my very conservative office job during the day. I didn't try it out before I bought it, which I wouldn't recommend to anyone, but it worked out well in this case.

Alien is a little pricey in my opinion, but I think its worth it since it lasts so long. The only downside is I feel like I'm wasting it since I'm spraying my room more than my body (since its so strong). I wish there was a way to cover the pump so I'm not scared to travel with it, but I guess I could always put it back in the box or something.

Long story short, I say buy!",4,Sephora,us
Alien,I get so many compliments when I wear this. My mom loves it too. Got it for her for mother's day.,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"Fragrance is such a personal thing so it is hard to write a fair review. I will say that this is very strong out of the gate but does dry down to a warm scent--after about an hour, on me I can really smell the amber. I went very light when trying this, and I am certain if I put it on pulse points or used a full-on large spray I would have had a headache. Also, I think this would be better suited for the winter months--for the summer it is just too heavy.",3,Sephora,us
Alien,"I'm not going to go into heavy detail as to why this perfume makes me gag, but... Ew. I bought the sample size to test the waters and definitely dodged a bullet. It's AWFUL! If someone finds a good perfume that lasts as long as this does though, let me know.",1,Sephora,us
Alien,"Alien is definitely a mature scent. I'm in college and I've been wearing it for a little less than a year. If you don't want the fragrance to come off as ""old lady"", I would recommend wearing this in the colder months. It really gives me the fall-winter vibes. It's a really strong perfume, so forget about spraying it on all your pulse points, because you're gonna give everyone in the room a headache or sneeze attack. Just a spritz in the air and shimmy through will do. Also, the bottle is gorgeous. A work of art in itself!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,I normally like fruity smells so I am sooo surprised that I love this one! I don't spray it on me directly...I am fully clothed and I spray twice in the air and walk into it. Sooo much better that way!! I will be refilling my bottle regularly!,5,Sephora,us
Alien,I love this scent. Absolutely beautiful. Every time I wear it I get compliments.,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"So many times I've tried this fragrance, and thought I didn't like it enough to buy. I received yet another sample, tried it. and boy, was it nice. First person I encountered after using it told me how wonderful it smelled!
I can't say I love it, nor can I even say what it smells like. It's soft, soothing, warm on me. I have a feeling I will continue to love this one more and more.",4,Sephora,us
Alien,Sadly I do not like this scent on me. It's very strong and the scent is hard to explain but not pleasant. I will be returning it.,1,Sephora,us
Alien,And I finally bought it...I'm still wondering why I waited so long because it was worth every penny! Very unique and hard to replicate scent that smells absolutely amazing. I can't say enough good things about Alien! I'm a life long fan,5,Sephora,us
Alien,Love the smell.Very strong and the best part is it is unisex so my husband also gets to wear it.It lasts almost 2 days. 1-2 pump are enough so 2 oz bottle goes long way. Was eyeing on it for like 8 months and grabbed it during 20% vib sale.,5,Sephora,us
Alien,I got a smile of this and it smells sooo good. I don't know if I will purchase the full size because it's very expensive. I love it though.,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"Ugh I can not describe how much I dislike this perfume. My best friend wears it and I'm forced to smell it all the time. It's so strong! I can't stand how long it lingers in my car even after she's gone. It lasts all day, I'll give it that. It is definitely an attention grabbing, unforgettable and unique smell...but not in a good way. I wouldn't describe it as sexy. More like Odd. Too warm and heavy. There's something in it that throws it off like it smells too spicy. If I found a dusty old bottle of expired perfume from the 1930s, I would expect it to smell like this. I guess it's an acquired taste.",1,Sephora,us
Alien,"I smelled this on someone and was in love. The funny thing is that they smelled this on someone else and fell in love too. I sprayed this on my son and he asked if he could wear it to school. My son is 16 and very macho. I warned him to stay away from my bottle. This smells so good that this morning my husband asked ""are you wearing that to work?"" I was like yes ..duh. He kind of got jealous bc this scent smells THAT good he wanted to be the only one enjoying the scent of me. I'm telling yall! This is IT! It reminds me of the smell of Givency but toned down. This will be my go to for a while.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"When I first smelled this on me, it smelled like I walked into a room in heaven where an archangel and jasmine flower just got done having hot sweaty passionate love making and then poured vanilla honey all over the room. It is the best thing in the world. I love jasmine though it is my go to scent but this perfume is the best expression of jasmine I've ever beheld. I've tried many perfumed and my skin always turns them to sugar, but this one stays warm and sultry and beautiful all day. This an bvlgari jasmine nori are the only two scents I will actually purchase because the jasmine is so beautiful and strong, not drowned out hy other notes and they don't turn to icky sweet sticky sugar on my skin",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I bought the smaller size and had to come back and order this one. It is an amazing scent, I get so many compliments on it... It is a very nice bottle and it is refillable, you can purchase a bottle that fits inside so it saves so money as well.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"Lots of notes of the perfume stick out to me in really good way...the vanilla, jasmine, amber. I just love how this perfume smells and I get compliments any time I wear it! It's more of a sexier scent than what I usually wear but it works for me!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,I have always loved the scent of Angel on others including my husband but it never quite captured me! Alien on the other hand is sooo me I am in love switched from obsession my first love to alien for good!,5,Sephora,us
Alien,I love this fragrance-I have used it for the last few years (on my third bottle) and look forward to putting it on everyday.,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I get compliments on this perfume EVERYDAY! It is amazing. Some perfumes fade after like, an hour, this perfume lasts you the whole day and the compliments will keep on rolling till its closing time! It's sexy,mysterious, luxurious. You feel like a million bucks wearing this perfume. The packaging is on point. It's smells so good you'd swear it fell upon this earth from another galaxy--hence, the name of the product.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"This has become my new favorite scent, incredibly sexy and I always get a ton on compliments when I wear it. It is a very unique scent and I am absolutely obsessed.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"So I got this as a gift. Oh my gosh, i used it once and I smelt like an old grandma for the entire day. Imagine an old grandma with a very strong perfume smell, that smells a bit bitter.

If you don't like floral or sweet scents, then this is for you.",1,Sephora,us
Alien,"I love this fragrance.. this is such a sexy scent!!! Always get compliments when I wear this. Two of my girlfriends have purchased this since smelling this in me. I wish I has our purchased the bigger bottle. But it is refillable .

I travel frequently. And this is travel friendless",5,Sephora,us
Alien,So this is apparently Harry Styles' favorite scent on a woman. Wonderful product! It smells great in the bottle but even more AMAZING on!,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I kept hearing these rave reviews, so I decided to try a sample before committing to an entire bottle because I usually disagree with everyone with regards to how ""awesome"" a perfume smells. Good move on my part.

This is just very warm jasmine. Apparently, it's meant to settle at some point into the lower notes, but honestly they remained largely undetectable with my body chemistry. All I got was a whole lot of jasmine, like a haute couture grandma. What I will say for it, despite the hype, is that it has strong sillage and lasts for hours.

Not for me, but if you're a fan of jasmine and warm fragrances, this is definitely an avenue to explore.",3,Sephora,us
Alien,The description describes it perfectly. It is a very luminous scent and felt like as the day went on I could smell the different tones come through. If you want to try something different this is a great pick.,5,Sephora,us
Alien,I received the sample and liked it a lot. I wasn't sure about the price but I took a chance and I am happy I did. The scent is sharp at first but after it mellows it is fabulous!,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I'm a Thierry Mugler fan all the way and I own four different fragrances as well as the body lotion and oil--however after running out of a nice handful of little samples of Alien that I kept I went to the sephora outlet and bought a 2 0z bottle of it expecting it to be the scent I enjoyed and trusted. I've been using it for about a month and a half now and I can say I'm positive that it's a completely different scent from the stock of samples I had for awhile. In fact had I not bought it in-store, I would think someone filled an empty Alien bottle with some water and cheap dollar store perfume to resell it! It's a very old lady-esque granny smell and I am rather displeased and disappointed, especially considering how devoted I have been to Mugler.",1,Sephora,us
Alien,"This is a really great scent. Sexy, different, feminine. If you like jasmine, vanilla, and amber, you'll love this. It's not citrusy or flowery at all.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I was so intrigued by the marketing for this product before I ever smelled it. ""Luminous like a brilliant solar flower . . . "" I didn't know what that meant, but I knew I had to find out. When I first tried a sample of Alien, I didn't know if I liked it. The opening note of jasmine is green, sharp, almost medicinal. As I wear it, though, the solar notes really do come through; it honestly does smell like warm wood, and the ""transparent amber"" adds another layer of warmth to the scent. So beautiful, so soothing, especially for something that starts out almost harshly. It's strong and long-lasting, mild enough for daytime, luxurious enough for night. Comfort and intrigue combine in this fragrance.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I love this perfume, it smells amazing I got the sample in the mail and I love it!! The scent stays all day and I'm always getting complimented on it!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I have Angel by Thierry Mugler, and I have liked it but I really liked this ""Alien"" scent when I got it in a sample and I will be getting the full size",4,Sephora,us
Alien,"This is probably the most unique scent I've ever owned (I also have Angel EDT and Angel). It smells musky and reminds me of tea. It makes a great night time or going out perfume, because it is a pretty strong scent.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"my all time favourite perfume EVER! and its cruelty free/vegan friendly. I don't even know how to describe this perfume other than amazing. It's long wearing, a nice, full scent, and just THE BEST. 100% worth the high price.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,The first time I used this from a sample I loved it. Such a unique scent. Now I got another one and it smells to old lady smelling. On the fence on this one.,3,Sephora,us
Alien,"I love this perfume. I'm usually quite fickle when it comes to scents, but this one is amazing. I use it all the time. It's strong enough that you only have to use a little bit, and it lasts! It's so hard to find a nice smelling perfume that lasts. Days later I can still smell it on my coat. It's amazing.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"Obviously fragrance reviews are subjective. I'm not a huge perfumer wearer, but it was a sample so I grabbed one. I like woodsy type scents, patchouli, sandalwood, etc but this is really strong. It's growing on me though. If you're sensitive to scents I wouldn't buy this. Definitely not an everyday fragrance (for me), maybe good for a night out or something.",3,Sephora,us
Alien,"Got the Sephora favorites perfume sampler, and decided redeem the free coupon within on Alien. This is a warm and intriguing scent. I get a lot of compliments on it.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"Received as one of my samples with my order. Not a fan of this one. IMO, it is overpoweringly powdery smelling and has strong undertones of skunk. Very old lady smelling. It kinda made me nauseous after a few minutes. If I were locked in a room with someone who had this on, I would be extra motivated to find a way out quickly. I prefer fresh smelling scents. I filed the sample into the trash.",1,Sephora,us
Alien,I've been wearing angel for years and tried a sample and fell in love! kinda reminds me of poeme from Lancôme but better! perfect for fall and winter,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"This scent is amazing. It smells sophisticated, a hint of blackberries, sexy & dark. Personally I think it's appropriate for everyday any occasion. It's my all time favorite, I've made it my signature scent. Also it lasts for days!!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I don't write many reviews but I felt like I had to share this one. I have long been looking for my ""signature scent"" and I have found it with this perfume. It has heavy jasmine notes but doesn't smell like ""old lady"" perfume. It is very unique and I get soooo many compliments when I wear it. It has a strong sillage but is not overpowering. Even my husband likes it and he doesn't care for perfume. I LOVE IT!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"This scent reminds me slightly of avons Carmela which is no longer available, but has a sweet and vanilla type of smell. This mixed with hints of gardenia. I think it is a very fun and flirty smell but not too sweet like candy. This is definitely a more mature smell. I got it as a sample from a different order and love it soooooo much.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"This is my most favourite perfume in the world. I've never smelled anything like it, it's so sophisticated and mysterious. It doesn't fade as fast as other perfumes, and I always get compliments and people can always smell it on me. I've repurchased the 2 ounce bottle multiple times and it's always worth the money!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I absolutely love this scent. I always found myself ""testing"" it in department stores and finally decided to buy it from Sephora just before the holidays. It made the perfect addition to all of my holiday outfits and I received so many compliments on it that I lost count. I love that the bottle is re-useable so I only have to buy refill bottles from now on.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"This scent is so versatile that I find myself using it both winter and summer, night and day. It is unique, feminine and daring. The fact that it is also in a refillable bottle means you do not have to feel guilty for throwing away such a beautiful bottle and refill it at a lower cost.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"This smells so beautiful I received a sample in my package and had to purchase the full size. I love this light powdery scent. It is not overpowering or strong. I will wear this all day and night, Can't wait. Do buy it is worth it.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,I started wearing this perfume back in 2007 and it's still my favorite out of all my perfumes. I have Flowerbomb and Gucci Guilty and none can't compare to Alien. Stays on all day and thru the night. I get compliments every where I go.,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"This Thierry Mugler perfume at first was offensive to me. I wore it a few times and disliked the initial spray.

The dry-off was very feminine and had lasting power. After the day's end, I found myself loving the smell. I was pretty much addicted to it after that. The jasmine notes were very prominent. Some people don't like this, but I am in love with it.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I happened to smell this on my friend's sister one day and I became obsessed with it! I asked her what it was called, bought it a few weeks later and it's been my signature scent ever since! I get compliments on how good it smells every time I wear it! Love this!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,Angel has the most reviews and my mom & sister love it so much.. But whenever I try it on my wrist it just don't work on me very well. But Alien is for me. I get lots of compliments wearing it. My signature scent for this season.,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I love it on me, but never buy any perfume based on reviews or on how it smells on paper in a magazine. You have to sample it on your own skin.",4,Sephora,us
Alien,"This perfume is amazing! It is that perfect combination of warmth and sweetness, with just a little something extra to keep it interesting. I always get a ton of compliments when I wear this! It lasts all day and is just so unique. I love it and so does my mom. I have already repurchased!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"When I got a sample of this, I tried it on all day and wasn't sure about it. I've always liked vanilla and coconut smelling things so this was out of my comfort zone. At first I thought it was too strong for me. Then I was out with my friends and they all kept saying how I smelled really good! The scent really started to grow on me so I decided to purchase it. I still receive compliments on how I smell all the time! It lasts a long time, so you don't need to spray much at all-- or it could get too over powering. It's a very different scent from anything I've ever tried.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,I had gotten a sample of this and had to buy the bigger version. A couple actually. The smell is enrapturing.. Interesting... I absolutely love it.,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I was skeptical that a perfume could prompt so many compliments, after all I usually think that when you can really smell someone's perfume that it's overpowering and gross, but I put this on and got a ton of compliments from people young and old. I'm horrible at describing scents, but generally I think you can trust the description provided; I pick up notes of lilac as well, but again, I'm not a fragrance expert. It lasts a decent amount of time for me, but given that I'm extremely active most of the time, that equates to being long wearing on the average person. It's expensive, but definitely worth it. Give it a try!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,This is by far the best perfume I've ever owned! I just bought another bottle since the bottle I bought earlier this year is almost empty! I'd recommend this perfume! I always get compliments when I wear it!,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"This perfume is one of the best perfumes ever!! I love that it is soft yet lasts all day!! I love perfumes that are different and I try to stay away from sweet and floral fragances. I strongly recommend If you like woody/oriental scents such as Euphoria, Lalique, and Guilty. Give it a try and you will not be disapointed!!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"My cousin turned me on to this scent, and I have since become obsessed. It's sexy and sultry, but in a totally wearable way. It lasts forever, all you need is a little bit.
I like to use Flowerbomb during the day, and Alien at night when I want a little edgel. Though lately I've been wearing this one everyday just to smell it on myself.
Woodsy, feminine perfection.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"This is inaccurate in one regard. The item listed as a rollerball is not. It is a spray. As I was really excited about having this in a rollerball, this disappointed me. I haven't seen this in a rollerball anywhere; everywhere it seems to be a spray.",3,Sephora,us
Alien,"This scent is great for all seasons, I always get questioned what scent am I wearing. Long lasting as well. Expensive but worth it!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"Based on the reviews, I thought ""I HAVE to get this stuff!""

Tried it on my pulse points, went on pretty strong and it definitely did last and linger throughout the day. In fact, I could still smell it on myself even after my shower the next day.

The scent is rather hard to describe... I would say it smells much like musky lavender baby oil. Not so much baby POWDER, which is a very distinct airy smell, but baby OIL which is a bit richer and heavier. I can see where one of the previous reviewers described a ""grape soda"" smell, as It does smell very... ""purple"" (if the color purple had a scent.)

It reminds me of a perfume I had when I was in middle school, Jennifer Lopez's ""JLo"" similar in the indescribable soft musky quality without the old lady feel.

I don't think this is ""The One"" for me like I had hoped it would be. But I will say that even though I wasn't completely in love with it, my husband did compliment me on it, and he usually doesn't notice perfumes. So I guess all the reviewers were right in that it does get you attention. Wearing it makes me feel very confident and womanly, so that's a plus even if I'm not totally in love with the scent. Still on a quest to find the perfect scent, but I will definitely keep this one as a backup.",3,Sephora,us
Alien,"one of my favorites, love the way it smells unique, not too flowery, my husbands gives me compliments all the time, i wear it on the weekends only.:) definately a keeper for me.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"Four stars due to expense... eighty dollars for only one ounce is pretty high! But being refillable is a plus, though I have yet to use it up. At first I disagreed with the top notes quite a bit but while trying to use up a small sample I fell in love, partially due to the compliments! Smells much better after it dries on the skin. This makes me feel mature after wearing sweeter candy scents like my fave JC perfumes :) but it's very sexy and literally everyone loved it on me. And I love that in a perfume, when it makes you stand out to someone! Unique and unexpected but a classic smell. Will refill when I do use it up, but I'm a perfume hoarder so that may take a while...",4,Sephora,us
Alien,LOVE LOVE LOVE!!! I get compliments every time I wear it,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"It is expensive, but if it mixes nicely with your skins phermones it is one of the best scents out there. I get asked what I'm wearing all the time, I love this fragrance!!! (ps i have soo many perfumes so i switch things up alot but this is my fav at the moment) :)",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"Unique, deep scent that LASTS. Refillable option saves you money too!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,Got a sample few weeks ago....FINALLY tried it yesterday....HAD to go buy a bottle after work yesterday. Finally found something to wear on days opposite Flowerbomb.,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"This perfume has such a unique and intriguing smell. I get compliments on it all the time. The smell lasts all day. Be careful, though, it's strong. A little goes a long way.

If anyone has any recommendations similar to this one, let me know! I'm in the market to expand my perfume collection.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I have been pretty faithful to Prada Candy, which I love, until the testers came out in Alien EDP early summer. I have to say, this one is now my FAVOURITE and I continually get compliments everywhere I go! As with all Eau De Parfums, this one smells MUCH better after it has a chance to work its magic-after being applied to your pulse points. The longer it is on, the better it smells and I personally like it as soon as it is sprayed on, but LOVE it once the temperature rises! I bought the refillable bottle, as it is more eco-friendly! My 17 year old daughter also is in love with this fragrance, so it just goes to show that it appeals to all different age groups!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"Bought this online with never sampling it. I had heard so many great things about this brand, unfortunately it just wasn't for me :-(",1,Sephora,us
Alien,Love this parfum my favorite,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I purchased the little bottle. I love the scent, however; it goes on VERY strong at first (almost too strong) but after a while it lightens up and smells very pretty. The four stars is due to the strong initial presence.",4,Sephora,us
Alien,"I have recently purchased Michael Kors Sexy, Versace Yellow Diamond and have been happy with them, but they don't excite like this one. I AM IN LOVE with this fragrance. I have to admit it grew on me and I didn't love it at first but then I gave the sample a full spritz. Like an Alien it was a little intimidating. It lasts all day and I cannot stop stealing a whiff of my wrist throughout the day. It is sexy in a sensual magnetic sort of way.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I really, REALLY loved how Alien smelled in the magazine page sample but when I finally shelled out the $50 for the smallest available size & tried it at home, the smell on my skin was downright disgusting. I know lots of people experience body chemistry conflict with perfumes but this is the first one that has affected me in this way.
Too bad because I love the refill capabilities. Hopefully other perfumes will offer that in the future.",3,Sephora,us
Alien,"I am totally inlove with this, received as a sample and got compliments had to go for full size. It is indeed pricey but worth it!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"This is soo good! It lasts all day or more! And I get so many compliments when I wear it, it was a warm vanilla note to it.",4,Sephora,us
Alien,"I got this as a sample and gave it a spritz. At first, it was like all the other slap-you-in-the-face fragrances where they couldn't decide on a balance so they just put ALL THE THINGS in it. Once it blooms, it really is alien. Is it a musk? A floral? Who knows. It takes far too long to settle and I can't wait several hours to even out. But you might like the adventure.

If you're into weird you'll love this.",4,Sephora,us
Alien,I am always looking for something that isn't too flowery or dainty. This is a super sexy and heavier scent. LOVE LOVE LOVE it. Get tons of compliments. Not every beauty product store sells it either - so I'm always coming back to Sephora for it. Wish it came in a purse spray and wasn't so expensive - but nothing tops it for me yet!,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I gave Alien 4 stars because it is a beautifully crafted and high quality perfume, but I have never encountered a fragrance that proves the rule to ""try before you buy"" so completely. I recieved a sample from Sephora and I knew it would be strong from just smelling the spray nozzle, but I decided to try it out (a tiny spray on each wrist) one day when I was just hanging around the house. The first minute was overwhelming, and then it settled down into the most gorgeous sugary jasmine layered over woods. I loved it; I almost jumped straight online to order a full bottle. Well, I'm glad I didn't because by minute 10, my skin had eaten all of the jasmine and vanilla and I was left with the sensation of being trapped inside of a cedar chest! An expensive cedar chest, but still. If your body chemistry is such that it holds on to the jasmine and vanilla in Alien, then you will adore this perfume and I am jealous of you. Otherwise beware - this is not a safe blind buy!",4,Sephora,us
Alien,"I LOVEEE this smell. I sprayed it on my wrist and my husband smelled and he instantly bought it for me as a gift. He loved it and I love it. It is such a warm powerful embracing scent, if that makes sense. Just smell it. You either love it or you hate it. I LOVE it!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I smelled this in the store and it was incredible. I finally caved and bought it. At first, it smelled so sensual and amazing and I got so many compliments. I don't know if it's just me, but I began to realize that the scent smelled differently hours after I sprayed it on than it did when I first put it on. It started to smell like bugspray and wood...which is not a very attractive smell. I absolutely love this perfume but I would definitely suggest trying it on in the store first and waiting a few hours to make sure the scent stays the same.",3,Sephora,us
Alien,i love it stays with u all day,4,Sephora,us
Alien,"I received a sample of this in a magazine and it instantly took me back to July, 1999 when I went to Europe with my high school.
I went to my first Sephora located at 70-72 Avenue des Champs-Élysées in Paris, France and there is a scent that hits you as you walk down the ramp. I will never forget the overwhelming beautiful scent; even though (imo) Sephora's here in the states all have a unique scent, nothing compared to Paris.
Well, this Thierry Mugler Alien is it! I cannot believe I actually found Sephora Paris captured in a fragrance. This will absolutely stay in my collection forever!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"This was purchased for my sister, who had smelled it in the store and LOVED IT, she not only emptied the bottle once, not twice but 3 times! Our local store lets us fill up the bottle which is nice, this is a win win b/c my sister likes it so much and on a side note while I was in line another customer chatted me up about how great this perfume was!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,This stuff is awesome. I try not to wear it everyday but sometimes I can't help it. I love this fragrance.,5,Sephora,us
Alien,Love this perfume! I prefer darker scents which are sexier and receive many compliments but this is a lighter version of dark and I can't get enough. After getting a sample and wearing it for one day I decided I HAD to have this!,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"It's okay, NOTHING compared to Angel which is my all time favorite. Wouldn't even purchase a rollerball.",3,Sephora,us
Alien,"I got a sample of this on my last order, and I love it so much I'm back for more! This is a warm, ever so slightly musky scent. I have smelled perfumes in this genre that were too sweet or too heady, but this one is PERFECT for that night/day when you want to add a little sexy.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,My new favorite fragrance!,5,Sephora,us
Alien,Every good review is right. I went into sephora looking for a perfume and came across this. Omg this is so unique. You know how if you smell to many perfumes it all just starts smelling similar? I was at that point and I sprayed this one and it was like an amazing explosion of smells. So womanly but bold. I love it. I really wish they had a rollerball of this. I was to broke for a full size. Whhhyyy don't they make a rollerballll???,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"Without giving a long and drawn out review, it's just lovely lite scent. It's not over powering and it's doesn't wear on you. I suggest to anyone that's interested in buying this scent, get a sample from sephora",4,Sephora,us
Alien,I got a sample of this from my friend in Italy and completely fell in love!!! Asking for this for my birthday for sure. Great musky scent with just a tiny bit of floral. Perfect and it lasts so long!,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I got ahold of a few samples of ALIEN, and I will be purchasing it on my next months Large order ! I was going to get FLOWERBOMB, but this scent is so intoxicatingly sexy, FLOWERBOMB will have to just wait a little longer to replace what I have used. I thin its cool that it can be refilled, but that is not a selling point for me at all..The bottle of Stone and the almost undescribable fragrance that makes me feel like a pin -up girl when it has been worn on my skin, Not all Fragrances work for everyone, but this one definitely works for me. Try to get a sample before purchasing to wear for a day to see how well it lasts and how it mixes with your own personal body chemistry !",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"When this first launched I wasn't interested in it and it wasn't my style. Now that I'm a little older I can appreciate how unique it is, and it's enchanting. Like Angel, it stays with you and you get your money's worth. This isn't flower water, it's real perfume that lasts for hours on end. Something about it reminds me of Dior Addict perfume (blue bottle). Only there isn't that dirty sandalwood and tonka bean combination in it. With this you get more jasmine.",4,Sephora,us
Alien,DID NOT LIKE IT ON ME.,1,Sephora,us
Alien,"I absolutely love Thierry Mugler. Womanity & Angel are crazy unique, and the same goes for Alien. The first time I smelled this, the only thing that popped out to me was menthol (maybe it's just because I used to be a smoker for 10 years, but Alien smelled exactly like a menthol Newport or Salem cigarette!) But hey, that's not necessarily a bad thing...in fact, the menthol makes it even more one-of-a-kind. Once it's on my skin, the vanilla and jasmine take over and it becomes even more intoxicating. I love that Alien lasts for hours and hours, isn't overly floral or overly sweet, and the bottle is just amazing. When compared to other typical perfumes out there, this one is definitely ""out of this world"" - I recommend this to all!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"This is a beautiful perfume with a bold yet sensual scent. I generally don't go crazy with my perfumes - usually just one or two sprays is sufficient - but with this perfume, I only need one, and it lasts the whole day. Actually, to be honest, it has lasted for two days on my wrists, even after showering, etc. The scent can be a bit overpowering, which is why I would recommend using it sparingly because it seems to have a lot of staying power. For that reason, the price is actually not as bad as it seems because you have to use far less of it.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,My absolute favorite perfume. I love that the bottle can be refilled because I know I'll be refilling mine again and again. I get compliments on it all the time!,5,Sephora,us
Alien,I love this perfume! I smelled it on a girl in the subway and knew I just had to have it! I can smell it throughout the day and it smells wonderful. Definitely a must try for anyone looking for a new fragrance.,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"Alien is the definition of the word unique. I can't compare it to anything else I've ever smelled before. I think the name 'Alien' and the branding behind this scent are perfect for it. Actually the name of it is what turned me off from trying it to begin with.. I thought to myself, ""Why would I want to wear something called 'Alien'? That's weird and I don't care for the connotation."" But then I smelled it.

When I wear this perfume I feel warm, inviting and feminine, in an otherworldly way, if that makes sense. Maybe it is the branding that influenced me to feel this way, or maybe it's just the scent itself, but whatever it is, it's certainly effective. Alien has an entrancing, soothing effect, like it's wafting all over and around me. It's strange and mysterious yet calming at the same time.

It's not my signature but it was my go-to during the colder months. And when fall and winter approach this year, it will be once again.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I wanted to love this scent so much - especially after reading so many rave reviews, but this scent just did not compliment me at all. I am guessing this perfume smells quite differently on the people who like it, but for me, I found it too strong, headache inducing, and reminded me of baby powder mixed with bug spray. I realize my personal opinion is going to gain a lot of ""not helpful"" votes, but if you're looking into this one, make sure you sample it a few times as it does smell differently when applied to the skin, as opposed to spraying it on the little cards in store. The bottle is so pretty and it really is a unique smell (not to mention you won't need to spray much for a lasting smell), but I just can't get past the fact that it reminds me of my childhood when my grandfather would spray Raid.",2,Sephora,us
Alien,"Seriously the best sexy sultry sent out there! It's a heavier sent that will definitely get you noticed. I also love that the sent lasts hours upon hours, it lingers on you and makes you smell soooo good most of the day.

Every time I wear it people constantly compliment me on it or at least are so intrigued to know what the fragrance is. It's definitely pricy but with all the compliments I get on it and how long it lasts- trust me it's better than wasting that $20 on some drugstore sent that reeks and won't get you noticed.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"This is an excellent night time scent that will seriously turn on anyone who gets a smell of you. It is sophisticated and mysterious smelling. It has a certain personality to it that begs you to leave of some accessories or frills because it is that last touch you need. A sort of liquid crown jewel of smell. I did not expect to like this because I tend to not be in to floral scents except ylang ylang mixed with fruity scents but this ""alien"" jasmine sent is so beyond any frilly floral scent your granny wore, it is liquid sexiness, an intelligent kind,",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"This has been my signature scent for almost 8 years now! I am so in love with the warm, moody fragrance. It doesn't matter what season it is, it wears well spring through winter. Alien is such a unique fragrance, I've yet to find anything that matches the gorgeous smell! Everytime I wear it I always get asked what it is, or complimented on the scent. Highly highly recommend!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,I love it and so doe my husband it stays with me all day previously I have used Angel this is now my new favorite,4,Sephora,us
Alien,this fragrance is very unique. It's not for everybody. It's a little strong when first applied but it quickly dries to a beautiful fragrance.,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I just had to have the gorgeous bottle. But when I tried on the perfume, I was thrilled with the scent too!'",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"There is something sweet and strange about this scent. The Jasmine pops right out and stays present for a long time. But beware that there is a very warm and sweet vanilla or candy thing going on too. So while it is quite sharp and Jasmine, the candy/vanilla thrown into it make for a totally ironic twist. I wear this better than Angel. Like Angel, this scent gets off on its contradictions/ clashes, but I think it does it in a more feminine and agreeable way than Angle.",4,Sephora,us
Alien,It was smell really nice I love it my favorite,5,Sephora,us
Alien,;)that fragance is Amazing!!!!! always every very ask for,5,Sephora,us
Alien,Love the smell. It not a obnoxious strong smell. It sophisticated. i must be an alien because i easily can get a headache from overwhelming smells. With this i don't. you won't regret the purchase!,5,Sephora,us
Alien,I first smelled this perfume 1 year ago and i fell in love. It took me so long to buy it because it is so expensive but there is a reason for that. It has the most exotic and beautifully majestic scent i have ever smelled. It isnt like anything else i have ever smelled and i get so many compliments when i wear it. This perfume it the best one out there.,5,Sephora,us
Alien,Wear it all the time...love it!,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I bought this on the suggestion of friends from the States; the Sephora in the part of China I live in carries a very small selection of scents and I wanted something unique.

When I first got this, I was skeptical (the same can also be said for Angel which I eventually loved). The smell was so strong and I didn't really like it. I almost gave it away; it initially smelled a lot like Clinique's Happy which wasn't a great smell on me.

Anyway, I just kept using for about a solid 3 weeks and eventually fell in love with it. I always get compliments on it and even though we're now transitioning into the spring and summer...I feel like it's still wearable.

Overall, I love it.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,I am very sensitive to fragrances & can only tolerate softer scents. I received a sample through the sephora VIP program. I loved it & my husband loved it. It's my new fragrance. Also like that it's refillable. Have to register online to get bottle refilled. Just bought it so I do not know how it is to get refill.,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"My six yr old grandson gave me a hug and said ""oh grandma you smell amazing"" it was my first time trying the sample I had received and is now one of my top favorite perfumes. I get lots of compliments from men and women when I wear it.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I love love loooooove this scent. I find myself spraying it on randomly just to breathe in the aroma. I'm no fragrance guru, so I can't comment on the specific notes, all I know is that it smells incredible and I get a boatload of compliments when I wear it, especially from men. It's sexy, mysterious, and audacious. Get you some.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"Love this scent. Smells unique, not like any other perfume that I've worn. Might not be everyone's cup of tea, but I do get many compliments !",5,Sephora,us
Alien,I love the notes this perfume display on my body when I wear it.,4,Sephora,us
Alien,This perfume is long lasting and unique. The scent lasts well over 24 hours and the sillage is fantastic. If you love the smell of jasmine this is the scent for you.,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"It smells different on all skin but it smells a little like floral/jasmine candy on me, super sweet. It reminds me of earl grey ice cream or a flavor of candy that doesn't exist, but should. Its unique and I'm glad I discovered it but it might be too glamorous for me. Just like everyone else mentioned, a little goes a long way and its a BIG smell.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,This fragrance is absolutely stunning. Be prepared to get LOTS of compliments.,4,Sephora,us
Alien,"The appearance of the bottle with the name Alien does not do the scent justice. It's sweet, light, interesting and as they say, very feminine.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"This is an amazing scent. I love this perfume, love and I'm not a perfume kinda girl so that's saying something. It's amazing and different, a must have.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"A little bit of Alien goes a long way to be sure! It is a magical, mysterious scent that smells slightly masculine, but also has a feminine undertone. If you are into slightly androgynous scents, this might be the scent for you! (But this scent definitely has feminine notes more than masculine ones!)

It is definitely strong, and an acquired taste, but is great! Worth spending the $$, because the bottles are refillable, and can be used again and again!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I am not into super sweet smells but this
One caught my attention, it's amazing and
Lasts all day.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,The best scent. Hands down,5,Sephora,us
Alien,Wasn't so sure about this at first but WOW is this an awesome smell. I was going to repurchase Angel (which I love) and decided to go with this. Everyone constantly asks what am I wearing (6 hours into my day its still going long lasting),5,Sephora,us
Alien,"Despite the costy price, it is a fantastic fragrance. Worth EVERY SINGLE PENNY!! Does not wear off during the day.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,This is an amazing and unique scent. One squirt goes a long way and it lasts all day long. The smell is complex and layered. The bottle is beautiful. And this is refillable!,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"Alien is the right name for this perfume. It is, well, weird and different, bold and daring, sassy, sexy, mysterious, sensual, seductive, edgy, very unique. Out of this world magical scent. You'll either love it, or hate it. There is nothing in between, only love or hate. I'm completely in love with it! My new favorite. And it's gonna last forever because you just need a little bit to last the whole day!!! It's very powerful. You have to be careful not to over do it, or it will give you and people around you a headache. Staying power of this perfume is out of this world fantastic. I just can't get enough of it. My sexy, alien love that makes me go ga ga over it :)",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"Alien is the most mysterious, glorious, seductive and amazing perfume I've almost ever tried. It's suuuuper long lasting, too which is a real plus in the fragrance department. I love florals and earthy smells, I'm not sure if this applies just stating my preferences. it's amazing. Buy it!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,Love the scent (and the bottle is gorge!) Definitely a great date night fragrance.,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"My boyfriend actually said, ""oh yeah, I remember this perfume, I really like this one"" after not having worn it two different perfumes prior. I switch perfumes up every time I finish a bottle, but I can't stop repurchasing this scent. My boyfriend loves it. I'm obsessed with it. I get compliments EVERY DAY about how I smell. Thanks, Thierry!

Also, I wouldn't consider this expensive because you only have to spray once (or twice) and you can smell it ALL day, versus cheaper options that you'd have to spray constantly for the same effect.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I'm a huge fan of perfumes with a HUGE collection as well. This is the most sophisticated perfume I have ever had!! It's different from other floral or feminine perfumes out there in the market. I always switch perfumes because I love perfumes and use different perfumes for different seasons. Sometimes I will love one perfume for a while and then just get tired, but this one is just special and I never get bored of the scent, and it makes me feel warm. Absolute feminine and mysterious as it advertised. It lasts long and definitely worth this amount of money.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I love this perfume because of it's different scent. It's a pricey perfume, but which ones aren't? The big 2oz resuable bottle isn't as cute as the other ones, but it does NOT have a sprayer. you have to dab it on. I don't know if this is a good thing or not because This perfume is VERY strong. one little dab will last all day on your skin. It's hard to tell when is TOO MUCH because it's so strong. I put way too much on my neck once and hugged my girlfriend on morning. her jacket still smells like it weeks later. be careful applying this stuff it's potent, almost too potent. which is why I gave it one less star from perfect. for some this would be a benefit though I'm sure.",4,Sephora,us
Alien,"I was never a fan of Angel so never thought to purchase any of Thierry Mugler's perfumes. A few weeks ago I'm getting my hair cut and my stylist smelled absolutely heavenly and the scent was driving me nuts, I knew I had to have it! My husband purchased it for me this month for my birthday and the comments I receive are amazing. I own probably in the area of 50-75 perfumes and I have to say this is by far the best I've smelled. I own some pretty unique scents but nothing matches up to this. And how cute is the refillable bottle!

Love Love Love!!!!!!!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"LOVE this sent. Says, ""I am woman ... hear me roar.""",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"The best perfume I've ever owned, and I am convinced will ever own. Lasts all day, compliments galore, beautiful scent, and it's so unbelievable versatile-- can be worn on many various occasions. What more could you ask for...",5,Sephora,us
Alien,I already have Angel. A customer at work had this on & its fragrance wafted through the store. So I bought it!,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I purchased this about two weeks ago because I had smelled it on someone and absolutely loved it. I had been liking it for a couple months now so I finally decided to go out and buy it. I wore it for about three days. One day not knowing how STRONG it is I did two sprays and it was extremely strong. I definitely think if you're more of a plain jane like myself, this would definitely be too much!",2,Sephora,us
Alien,Love love love ! So beautiful,5,Sephora,us
Alien,I have never gotten so many compliments on a perfume before I bought this one!!! It's the best one I've ever used by far!,5,Sephora,us
Alien,This scent is so unique. It is gorgeous!!! I went through a couple of samples before I made the decision to get this and I'm so glad I do. I love Thierry Mugler's scents!!! Thank you for creating my signature scents.,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"As I lie here 21 hours after applying this stuff, I can still smell a faint trace of Alien if I try. Exhilarating when it goes on, it is a warm, powerful, cozy fragrance perfect for the dead of winter. Very feminine without being disgustingly floral or cloying. I don't have a signature scent per se, but I accidentally bought two bottles of this stuff and I'm not disappointed.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"People either love or hate Mugler's perfumes! There really isn't an in-between!
I am a fan of Angel, and I've worn it for years, but Alien is REALLY special! It's an adult scent because it's very feminine and sexy! Even when I dress down in jeans, this perfume makes me feel beautiful!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"First off, this is not for the weak hearted. People either love or hate Thierry Mugler scents, there is nothing in-between.

I work selling fragrances and this is one of our best sellers. Spraying it on a piece of paper does it no justice. It melts with your skin to create a unique scent, and it is different on everyone. I hated this at first, being someone who loves Coach, Marc Jacobs and lighter floral scents. But I tried, every day I sprayed a little or used the lotion. IT SMELLS MUCH BETTER WHEN IT HAS SET ON YOUR SKIN. It becomes less overwhelming. It is described as a woody, amber, solar-flower scent. Sweet and mysterious. It's strong. If you like scents that last ALL DAY, you will like this. From being a lighter floral gal, this is my go to perfume for a night out. It's also a great value because these bottles are refillable and you save $30. I suggest to everyone to try this on in person, and walk around for at least a half hour before purchasing.",4,Sephora,us
Alien,"<3<3<3<3
It's delicious, good lasting power
and I have gotten quite a few compliments with this one",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"The fragrance is unique, I don't know how to explain it. But it smells fantastic. I get compliments on it all the time. Definitely am going to get the refill bottle for this one.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"This perfume is really special. Not everyone likes it, and it definitely changes on the wearer's skin, but it's also immediately recognizable and I've been stopped and asked about it by both men and women. Thierry Mugler makes great fragrances that last on the skin. My favorite is when the perfume gets trapped in the leather of my watch band. It is quite strong and heady and a little goes a long way- only a spray or two and it can be worn in the daytime, a couple more and it's perfect for night.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,I fell in love with the scent and it last on me through out the day. I don't wear perfume often because I swear it doesn't stay on. But this is heaven.,5,Sephora,us
Alien,It smells beautiful and exotic,5,Sephora,us
Alien,Received as a sample. It stinks. I do not like it. I think the adverts are pretty and make the perfume seem like it smells good but it's overpowering and pungent.,1,Sephora,us
Alien,"This is my HG scent, for sure. My mom wears Angel and I wear Alien and the two are just amazing! This one in particular is such a special scent. And it literally lasts all day. It is a bit pricey, but from that standpoint of it lasting so long it is well worth the splurge. I will never be without Alien on my perfume shelf!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"Truly unique and nice, this fragrance is mysterious, but also feminine and familiar. This is sweet but just right. Love it!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I first smelled this on my friend and knew I had to get it right away. It smells differently on me but still, the scent is amazing! It's definitely an either you love it or hate it perfume (my friend who usually shares my perfume preference hates this) so I'd suggest smell before you buy and test out a sample on your skin first. It lasts a while on me. The only downfall is the price but worth it!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"This fragrance is unique,powerful,mysterious,and heavily. This is my one of my FAVORITE scents of all time.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,I got a sample of this and fell in love with it immediately so I got the full size product. People literally compliment on my scent when I wear this.,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"The first 10 seconds after spraying this are fine, but after it settles it smells like you spilled a bottle of baby powder all over yourself. Not sexy or appealing. The one smell I hate more than anything is baby powder. Just not appropriate for me,",1,Sephora,us
Alien,"I liked it at first, it has a refreshing bright smell, I am guessing its the solar accord. But then it turns sharply into some kind of green grass & baby powder. I really loathe powder smells. The jasmine gets buried by it all. I get no vanilla and a terribly synthetic amber. It is not light & it does start to trigger a headache. It's not something I could wear but I love the name & the bottle.",3,Sephora,us
Alien,I tried Alien two months ago after trying several others. I love it-people follow me around the grocery store to get the name of the perfume- it is not strong-it is just so clean and pleasant. Greatest ever!,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I got this as a free sample, and It really is an Alien, its an entity alright as once you touch it or get any of it on you no matter what you do or how many times your try to wash it off it never leaves! I only opened the tester jacket and some got on my hand and the smell is nasty like old lady perfume and no matter how many times I washed my hands and even used vinegar the smell never would wash off.
I recognized the pungent odor right away many women wear it while in stores and once you walk through there perfume halo it attaches to you- run",1,Sephora,us
Alien,I am so picky about perfume that my girlfriends tease me about it. I absolutely fell in love with this scent. It's the first perfume I've liked in about four years. I'm sad because I'm out. I'm praying someone sends me some for Christmas be I can't afford to buy any for myself for another month or so.,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I don't want to give this such an amazing review because I don't want everyone to buy it out! I have used this fragrance for 6 years and I am in love with it. It' kind of musky and spicy, but very sensual and seductive. It isn't too sweet, great for a night out or during colder months. I've easily repurchased this nine times. Thierry Mugler's Angel scent was never really right for me, but for some reason I just adore this one. What's great is that not as many people use this scent, but I personally believe it is so much better than Angel! Try it out next time you're in store!

Also I think it's important to mention that I get stopped on the street multiple times from people asking me what scent I'm wearing. I guess that's the true test of a good perfume!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I finally found a scent for going out that I almost don't want to share it by reviewing.

Its feminine, mysterious, with a little bit of spice. Strong enough to carry through the night, but not so overwhelming that it would knock you out.",4,Sephora,us
Alien,"This perfume was a gift two years ago from a friend, and now I'm four (refill) bottles in, and there's no going back. I always get compliments on this scent (which is almost every day!) and I love how unique it is. The bottle is also so beautiful, and the fact that I can get refills for less than a full bottle's price - AWESOME. There is no other perfume for me.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"It has such an unique, sensuous scent.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,This is my favorite perfume! A little expensive but you refill the bottle.,5,Sephora,us
Alien,Sultriest of all...everyone wants to know what it is.....long lasting and invigorating..,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"This is my favorite perfume to wear and it is long lasting. Just like the other reviews, I too get complemented and asked what perfume I am wearing.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"The only perfume I've ever worn that multiple people have begged to know what I was wearing. Men have asked me so they can buy it for their girlfriends and wives. When I first started dating my fiance he would say it took his breath away, and he always wants me to wear it.
I bought the large bottle about a year and a half ago and haven't even used half - I just need one spray. It is so worth the money, and has crazy staying power. I've used it for years and still catch myself smelling my wrist. Amazing. Unique.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I love this perfume, smell good!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I love this Perfume , Thierry Mugler knows her perfumes, I loved Angel and now Alien is one of my favors, I love the sweet and spicy small, it goes well with my mood when I want to dress up for a nice dinner date of a night out with the girls...",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"The scent was too strong/spicy to wear for a day-to-day perfume. Might be good for a night out, but even then was a bit too overpowering.",3,Sephora,us
Alien,"A unique and incredible scent! I get compliments every single time I wear it, this is the only fragrance that I have bought over and over again, it's perfect.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I had gotten a sample of this perfume some time ago and have been wanting it ever since. I received this as a gift and it was well worth the wait. It smells wonderful, a bit strong, but very sweet smelling. The bottle is a hoot and sits well on my makeup table. I typically wear Chanel's Chance and Gardenia by E. Taylor, but I have a feeling Alien will become my new main.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"This fragrance is a great example for the quote ""you get what you pay for""
I haven't found another fragrance that smells like this. Definitely will repurchase .Alien is such a unique fragrance, the sweet notes mixed with a combination of musky notes and etc. gives off a very mysterious scent. The notes all compliment each other so well that is smells like one big amazing scent that is hard to distinguish what each note is. It's expensive but it takes only one spritz . I spray it on one wrist rub it on the other and then the left over will be rubbed on both sides of my neck. This will make you smell throughout the day. Smells sexy and mysterious. My boyfriend that is sensitive to scents find this one to be okay as long as i don't spray it in front of him. Although everyone's scent tolerance is different , I highly suggest to go smell the scent first before buying because it is a fairly strong fragrance.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"Perfume tends to last only a few hours on me but this lasted all day. I didn't like it at first, but when it interacted with my skin, it smelled so much better. LOVE IT!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"Alien exudes class; it is truly unique, an effortlessly bold fragrance designed for neither the masses nor for the faint of heart. While it goes without saying (or certainly should), test this and/or *any* fragrance prior to purchase. Everyone's body chemistry interacts with any fragrance in its own distinct way. I personally am thrilled by the result of my own interaction with Alien.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,I always get compliments when wearing Alien.,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"The bottle looks so wild, the smell is so different and spicy, I really wanted this to work, and I liked how it smelled on me (kept smelling my skin, haha) but after an hour it was clear that it's too strong for me, I get headaches from perfume. I would adore this perfume on someone else, even a guy (although it's not after-shavey, just not-floral). It was hard to wash off, I can tell you it really lasts! Lowest 1-star rating because I can't wear it, bonus star because I wish I could.",2,Sephora,us
Alien,ive been wearing this perfume every day for the past two years and i am constantly told how good i smell! lasts all day and couldnt be more obsessed,5,Sephora,us
Alien,I do recommend this scent because it smells so good and I probably looked weird smelling my wrist every 10 minutes. But I had it for about a year and the scent changed! It doesn't smell awful and I sometimes still wear it but sometimes I just can't stand it. I do recommend the small bottle (the one I have) if you plan on going through it fast.,3,Sephora,us
Alien,I always get compliments on this fragrance...and from total strangers. It's such a good smell!,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"Sprayed this on a sample card at the store, came home and kept smelling it!.. Loved it so I went back and bought a bottle!.. Smelled unique. Unfortunately didn't smell the same on me. Smelled very musky. Ended up returning it.",3,Sephora,us
Alien,It took a week to get use to - is a strong scent.,4,Sephora,us
Alien,"I was hesitant because I despise the smell of Angel, but after a lot of glowing reviews I tried this in the store.

At first, smelling it in the bottle/the sprayer I was put off a little. Not sure if I really liked it.
Tried a sample for a few days, thought I really liked it and about the 2oz bottle.

Now after having it for about 2 weeks I am not sure. I like the smell, but have been told conflicting ""I like that!"" and ""It smells a bit like an old lady"".

Plus, unless it's in my hair the smell hardly lasts til noon. Infact, I literally just smelled the exact part I sprayed at 8am and 4.5 hrs later it's not even noticeable at ALL.

So all in all, while I think sometimes I really like the smell and other times question if it's an 'old lady' smell - for the price you need to LOVE it and it should last at least a few hours. I know that not every scent lasts all day long.... But for this price it should IMO.",3,Sephora,us
Alien,My daughter spayed herself with this while visiting a Sephora in columbus. As we walked down the street I couldn't help but to stop and sniff her! I just kept asking her what she sprayed because she smelled sooooo good and I could smell it as we were walking. Luckily she remembered what the purple bottle looked like. I gave this to my mother in law and she gets compliments ALL the time. I wish I would have kept it for myself!!,5,Sephora,us
Alien,I have had so many people stop me and tell me that I smell sooo wonderful!! It smells absolutely fabulous!,5,Sephora,us
Alien,I've always loved Jasmine and find that it's over powered/mixed with other things too often that make it an after thought. Not Alien!! Gorgeous! I'm in love <3,4,Sephora,us
Alien,"This smells so good and lasts all day.
My husband complimented me on this, and he never notices fragrance.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,I love this product! This is my signature scent and I get so many compliments on it. I love the ability to refill instead of buying a new bottle each time.,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I tried this fragrance on a whim, my husband chose it for me and I love it. I was kind of leary because I don't like ""Angel"" at all, but to my very pleasant surprise this smells wonderful. I get compliments all of the time from men and women alike. I also love the fact that it stays with you all day long.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"This perfume is just legendary,It smells so unique. Especially it is the bestest for night out.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,Guess you either love or hate this fragrance-Glad I adore it. It is very different smelling. I did not like Angel at all this is more me. I took one star off because this simply does not last on me. I have deep envy of those who says it lasts forever. So if you think you want to try it and have a Sephora near you go get a sample and take for a test run. I bought a full bottle even though I knew it didn't last on me-it was too lovely not to have one.,4,Sephora,us
Alien,"I have been looking for a new signature scent for YEARS, and also collect fragrances. I never paid a lot of attention to TM fragrances because I have always liked ""classic"" floral fragrances that are usually bottled in traditional, pretty bottles. I sprayed this on just out of curiosity and went about shopping. Three people stopped me while still in the store and asked me what I was wearing. It turns out TM fragrances work with my body chemistry beautifully. Both Angel and Womanity work too, but Alien is my favorite. I have over 100 bottles of perfume, and I can't resist using Alien almost every day. It is heavenly on me. Not a good blind buy though, it needs to be tested on skin first. I have smelled it on other people and it is a love or hate relationship. I LOVE it!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,I can only hope Thierry doesn't do what Armani and the rest of the designers do and pull product when it is a big seller. I totally understand supply and demand but nothing is more frustrating. I have three of his scents now and this by far is the best one. Keep them coming Thierry.,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"Rich, deep and long-lasting. This fragrance has everything I'm looking for! Interesting reusable bottle is easy to grasp and spray. The deep interesting fragrance mellows to deep vanilla and lasts!! Love it!! Plus it has a large sillage (presence), and sophisticated palette of scent.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I am not a fan of Angel so I was reluctant to try this, well I am glad I did. It is a very sexy scent, love it for evening. IT lasts all day and I always get compliments on this when I wear it. Love the bottle too!!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,I know that all perfumes smell differently on everybody. But this smellef like ant spray on me. I needed to take another shower to get the smell off of me.,1,Sephora,us
Alien,"I fell in love with Alien while on vacation in Las Vegas a few years ago in Sephora, and finally got it for my birthday! I love it so much, the length of the wear of the fragrance is phenomenal and everyone always asks what I'm wearing;)",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"This was an amazing discovery. I got the sample from the last time I purchases from Sephora, and my gosh... this stuff is completely sexy, intoxicating, delicious, 'grown up' but not 'old lady'. This is not something a 16 year old would wear. I'm a wife & a mom of 7, and work hard to still be sexy & feminine.... this does it!!! Just for reference, I also love Romance by Ralph Lauren, La Vie est Belle by Lancôme, Crystal Noir by Versace and now- Alien!!! I'll clearly be adding this to my ""please buy this for me, hubby!"" birthday list ;)",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I find this to be very similar to ""Poison"" by Dior from yesteryear...and not just because of the purple bottle It's comlex, alluring, very grown up.",4,Sephora,us
Alien,"I got this as sample and like the scent. It's hard for me to describe but as someone else wrote it's pretty sexy. The only downside is that it doesn't have the best staying power, but fragrance doesn't seem to last long on me so your mileage my vary. I've found Boyfriend to be the only one that lasts all day on me and that's pretty strong.",4,Sephora,us
Alien,This was incredibly vinyl like on my skin. People noted it smelled strongly of a car cleaner. I wanted this to work for me so badly.,1,Sephora,us
Alien,"I realize that Thierry Mugler fragrances are polarizing scents, but count me on the end that LOVES them! I have to also add, you gotta love a perfume that requires only one spritz to have you smelling delicious ALL DAY!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"When I smelled this on a woman passing by I had to ask what she was wearing, it smelled so nice. I have a hard time finding fragrance for me since I am so sensitive. I tried to find a sample of this in stores to try it out but was not able to so I ended up ordering the full bottle. I was so excited to receive this that as soon as the package arrived I opened it and sprayed on my wrists. It was so strong that I had to wash it off. I then tried to spray in the air and walk through the mist as suggested by others but that only burned my sinuses & throat. I also tried mixing one spray with some lotion but that didn't weaken it either. Sadly I ended up returning to Sephora :-( The sales associate was curious that she sprayed it at the store and all of the customers stopped and asked what it was, everybody loved it. This perfume just did not work for me.",3,Sephora,us
Alien,"I absolutely love this fragrance, but it is SO incredibly STRONG! I literally sprayed one small spray and I am overwhelmed and am getting a headache. However, listen, the fragrance itself is divine. It's so unique and beautiful, but you need to get the EDT!!! Go to TM's website for the EDT, it's much softer and so nice. And beautiful! But Alien is beautiful, too, just strong as all heck. Maybe if you sprayed once, then cut with some rubbing alcohol? It's just STRONG people! Headache city! But divine, delicious smelling headache city... Get the EDT!!",4,Sephora,us
Alien,"I am totally in love with Theirry Mugler's ""Alien""! Almost every time I wear it, women tell me I smell wonderful and have to ask what it is I'm wearing! That has never happened with any other perfume! On me, the scent starts sharp and green. It mellows beautifully to a soft floral musky scent.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,I love it! It is a beautiful scent.,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I haven't fully made up my mind about it yet. I can't say I love it, but I don't dislike it either. It has an odd sophistication to it - makes me imagine that an alien species has set out to manufacture a fragrance and they did their best to understand and emulate humanity. While it fails to stand out as much as I had hoped (the aliens must have conducted serious research), there is a chance I'm underestimating the strangeness factor (the ""synthetic""-feeling element in the top notes).
There's something very strong and statement-y about these top notes; once they start fading, I usually notice that the smell has made me hungry (no headache, though, which is a good thing), but also that the fragrance has left a warm, very ""human"" ""core"".
Things it is: strong, vaguely odd, possibly more noticeable than half of the fragrances out there; this might as well be the smell of a clumsily-cyberfuture that's more the ""normal"" slow, predictable evolution of the present than a sudden sci-fi-insipred ""jump"". :)
Things it is not: fresh, ""open"", floral, ""free"".
I couldn't try it out in store - they did not have it here yet. If you are considering buying it, please test it out, the chance of hating it does exist.",4,Sephora,us
Alien,I am mist-ifyed by this scent (insert eye rolling here for cheesy coment but it's true this scent is very unique) I really love the smoky deep quaulity to this scent i couldn't stop smelling the tester or the spray card I will be buying this!!! it will almost be to the point of nigh weirdness because I will be smelling my own wrist all day possibly more then the people around me trying to wrap my head around the conundrum (puzzle) of this scent!,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I smelled this in the store and fell in love instantly! I am a perfume fanatic and have my very own Dillards counter in my bedroom, but this one definitely ranks the highest among them all. You will receive compliments from men and women alike!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I like this fragrance, because it's very uniquely formulated. It's kinda like a mystery, everytime I try this fragrance. i get note of chocolate, rose, jasmine, it's kinda a playful mysterious scent that's why the name is so fitting.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"When I first smelt this perfume it seemed very ""grandmother overdid her perfume"" but since I was in charge of promoting it I sprayed it only on my left wrist and pressed that to my right. Immediately the ""grandmothers perfume smell"" seemed I lightened & for the rest of my shift I receive Ed compliments asking what perfume I wore.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,I was given a sample of this and it has become one of my favorite scents to wear. Very sexy and feminine..my boyfriend goes crazy and mentions how much he loves the smell every single time I wear it.,5,Sephora,us
Alien,The perfume smells so good and get compliments every time I wear it. It feels like it's made with an oil so the smell stays on you longer. It's a smell that is soft and very feminine. Perfect for the spring and summer.,5,Sephora,us
Alien,Don't be deceived by the name. I feel rather sexy and playful when I am wearing this fragrance!! It smells heavenly.,5,Sephora,us
Alien,This was one of those perfumes that i never even thought to smell. Im glad i did though i was totally surprised how great this actually smelled! I LOVE jasmine and this has a very beautiful light jasmine scent to it. Its just light enough that it doesnt take over the whole perfume. This is very strong and long lasting which is great for me! Seriously its one of those perfumes that stays on things forever haha!,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"Smells so good! When I wear it, men and women tell me how good I smell and ask me what I have on! I love Alien a lot more then Angel, it is not ""musk-y"" like Angel. I recommend this product to any woman who enjoys smelling great!!!!!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"Not feminine at all. SO strong and musky, it smells like a cologne for men. One spray of this on someone nearby and it's all you can smell for HOURS, and it gives you a headaches. It's absolutely the worst perfume for women I have ever smelled and men do not like it. Should be marketed as pepper spray.",1,Sephora,us
Alien,"I am not one to write reviews but this perfume deserves praise! I have worn Michael By Michael Kors for about 8 years. I was getting my hair done the first time I smelled this perfume. My hair girl told me about it and said she gets stopped everywhere she goes when she has it on.

It took a little bit of convincing to make the switch but I did recently and I too have been stopped by both men and women asking what perfume I am wearing. I spray it once and it lasts all day!! Even after I wash my clothes they still smell like the perfume. My car and sheets smell like it too!! This is a perfume that is perfect for women who want their own ""signature"" smell! Its unforgettable and delicious!!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I am in love with this perfume! Whenever I where it, I always get compliments and it lasts all day with just a couple sprays. This is definitely worth the money and one of my favorite perfumes.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"Just the description alone lured me in. I bought it...wasn't in love it completely. Tried Angel. Angel dried down on me like pencil shavings. All I could think about was Alien. I am now addicted. It dries down to the warm, amber scent that's delicious. At first spray, it smells a little floral and jasmine toned. But as it works with your body chemistry it is just amazing. My new signature scent!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I'm not one of those people that use perfume regularly, but after being intrigued by this perfume online, I was eager to smell it in store. I realized that I need a signature perfume, one that makes me smell distinct among my friends and co-workers, so I was open to spending BIG BUCKS on my new perfume.

I smelled this in store and was unfortunately not impressed. I was so happy to try it and basically buy it on the spot, but it didn't leave me in AWE. Before I left the store I sprayed it all over myself and went to work, to see if it would grow on me. And boy, it TOTALLY DID. It truly develops over time. At first it smells kinda sweet, then it starts to smell softer, then by the end of the day you're left with a musky sexy scent with hints of the previous scents. I got so many compliments on my scent that I just HAD to get it by the end of the day.

I'm so lucky to find my signature scent after ONE TRY.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"This is by far the most wonderful perfume scent. I've worn it for the past 4-5 years and still can't get over it. The feminine fragrance has a combination of amber, vanila, jasmine, orange, and woodsy notes.The original description says it is an elixir of magic captured în a weird-shape bottle, which is supposed to remind us of the philosopher's stone or of a ""warlock"" object in a violet, mistique nuance. Its interpretation sounds like the woman wearing it has some kind of magic spell she spreads to those around her. As cheesy as is sounds, I must agree it's true, as its strong, persistent and irresistible smell it emanates cannot get unobserved, Although I'm crazy about perfumes, most times I'm very picky since I'm allergic to mostly anything, so it's really hard to chose something I both like and tollerate. This is definitely one of them and I'd totally recommend Alien to all women.
P.S: I really don't work for the brand! :))",5,Sephora,us
Alien,My daughter was telling me about Alien. She knows how much I love Angel. This was a nice change. Lighter than Angel. I would definitely buy Alien again!! I have received many compliments!!,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I almost did not want to write this review because I didnt want other people to wear it. I am absolutely in love with this perfume that I can just drink it. When it first came out, I had a sample and I received so many compliments that I needed to buy it. Ive abandoned all my other perfumes because I love this one so much.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"This so called perfume would be better marketed as bug spray! It gave me the most horrendous headache ever and made my boyfriend gag. I had to shower, but I could still smell this discusting scent. Immediately threw away!!",1,Sephora,us
Alien,"i got a sample of this and it was trialed by me, my mom, and my friends. It is phenomenal. Sexy but at the same time classy. There's a very flirtatious tone to it, while all maintaining dignity, meaning it absolutely does not slip into the too-sweet-too-trashy scent that many sexy perfume easily tip over into.

Most impressive part of my experience with it: it dominates. Its scent is strong, unique, and consistent, but it's not strange. You can pick it up in a crowd and just KNOW that's the scent standing out the most, and every other perfume doesn't matter because this is the one that'll leave you with impressions.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I bought it for my girlfriend for Xmas, but in reality, I bought it for myself! It's my favorite fragrance! She ran out of it thanks to me, so I figured that I would kill 2 birds with one stone by buying it for her for Xmas and restocking our fragrance as well! Shhhhh..... She doesn't know! Lol...",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I’ve heard many wonderful things about this perfume, so I was very excited to try Alien. I do like how Alien is both unique and simple, but this is one fragrance that I just can’t get on board with.

It starts off with a strong scent of jasmine, but there is a strange chemical/alcohol odor mixed with it. The alcohol smell fades away after 15 minutes, but there is still something very synthetic and artificial that remains. On the other hand, the jasmine stays very present and strong, and the woods give it a bit more depth. I just wish that plastic smell would fade.

After about three hours of smelling jasmine and synthetic plastic, the woods and amber become much stronger and give the fragrance an earthy, slightly sexy feel. The fragrance still smells like plastic, but at least it smells more grounded and woodsy. It seems as though Mugler intentionally wanted Alien to smell artificial and to remind buyers of the perfume’s construction. It’s as though purposefully smelling artificial is part of Alien’s charm.

Basically, Mugler’s Angel and Alien are both perfumes that rely on concepts. Alien was conceived from a mysterious, beautiful scent that he smelled while on a plane and was also influenced by city lights. Giving the name “Alien” even contributes to the idea of creating a strange, mysterious scent that stands apart from other modern fragrances. It smells unique despite relying on just a few main notes, but personally, I feel as if the uniqueness comes from smelling deliberately artificially designed, which is something I do not want to wear.

Despite my personal disinterest in wearing Alien, I praise Mugler and his perfumers for materializing his concept. When I smell this fragrance, I am reminded of beautiful solar lights in the distance of a dark night. There’s a warmth to Alien even if I imagine the warmth is coming from light bulbs rather than natural light. I don’t consider Alien sexy (except for the last couple hours when the synthetic smell is not as strong), but it’s mysterious and strange. And I like how the bottle even looks unique. It has a beautiful amethyst color with weird claws that add to this futuristic feel.

I think this is best worn for cooler days, when I would be able to really appreciate the amber and woods. I don’t imagine that it would be overbearing or offensive if worn on warmer days though. It has great longevity on me—lasts for several hours all day. It does come out strong in the beginning, but it eventually mellows out on my skin after a half hour and is not overwhelming. If you like jasmine and woods, you should check out Alien. Try it on and see how it wears.",3,Sephora,us
Alien,This perfume has a very elegant scent. It is soft and I love that it is a very different smell. And that its not too powerful. It lasts all day ! I would recommend !,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"This is a sexy, unique fragrance. The first time I smelled it (my friend uses it too), I really didn't like it. However, this is a scent that really grows on you, and I bought it for myself as soon as I could!
I like this fragrance because it is unique and complex. I feel sexy and confident wearing it, and reserve it for nights out on the town and nice dates. I would describe it as having musky, vanilla, and amber notes... I usually like lighter fragrances, but this one is an exception.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I was in the department store buying Angel when I tried Alien and I was hooked. It has an enticing, adult smell- the kind to attract everyone yet it's for ""adults"" the women who know exactly what they want and how to get it!!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"Hands down my favorite perfume no questions asked. When I wear any other perfume I feel like I am cheating on Alien. It is sexy, mysterious, and slightly masculine--but in an awesome way. Love.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,Always get compliments on this perfume. I have been using it for the past year and it is my definate go to perfume.,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"This is a very stinky perfume that takes a special nose to appreciate. If you don't like woodsy scents, definetely do not buy this.",3,Sephora,us
Alien,All of the Mugler fragrance are like nothing I have ever smelled before. They truly do not remind me of anything else. The alien in my opinion is one of the better ones; it has a bit of a sweetnes to it. They are refillable like the others which is great.,3,Sephora,us
Alien,Une allure mystérieuse de l'amour! It exudes an allure unknown to any scent before. It is a mysterious love.,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I was at Sephora this morning to do an exchange, had been curious about this scent and sprayed some on. Couldn't stop smelling it all day! This scent really is different, bewitching, mesmerizing and compelling. Memorable and different.
I didn't buy it but keep thinking...
Problem is that I just bought a bunch of scents so how long can I hold out?
If you're wavering or want something outstanding buy this scent!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"This is the most amazing scent I have ever come across. There is absolutely nothing like this perfume. I have a ton I perfumes and I always swear by this one. It's one of those scents that when you put it on, it makes you feel instantly more confident. Last but not least, a little goes a long way and it doesn't wear off like many other perfumes. I think this will always be my favorite scent.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I hate flower scents so I was told that I might like this perfume and I tried it, liked it and bought it. But after spraying it on myself i didnt like the way it smelled on me so I returned it.

A year later I still had the samples in my drawer so I decided to give it a try once again. And I fell in love, I guess I needed to wait a year to grow into this scent. I bought this again and now it is my favorite scent. Now 3 year later I still use it as my ""Ultimate favorite perfume."" I used up 2 bottle and now I just buy the refill bottles since they are much more practical and less pricey.

Everyone: don't dismiss this perfume right after spraying. Go to sephora spray some and wear it for a day. the perfume changes its smell and you might like the effect.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I love this perfume it smells wonderful. I found it to be powerful but not overpowering. It didn't irritate my nose at all which is a huge thing for me. It's sweet, sexy and very exotic. The scent like the description says is mysterious. I checked my other perfumes to see if there is anything like it and I didn't find any similar. The bottle I love as well, purple is my favorite color. It sprays easily but I kinda didn't like how so much comes out, I have to be a little gentle with it because this isn't cheap and it did spray a stream. Hopefully it might just be my spray is a defect.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I've been browsing through the other reviews. All I can say is that I'm glad I have the right chemistry for Alien. It has been my favorite scent since its inception. For me, it has terrific staying power; I have to go lightly to avoid overdoing it. And it smells wonderful on me. I have never noticed any grape soda notes, just warm, sexy and exotically delicious. This one would never be mistaken for a drugstore perfume. The first time I wore it to a party, my girlfriend passed me around from person to person just so they could be intoxicated by my neck. I will certainly never forget that! And all of the men absolutely loved it. Need I say more?",5,Sephora,us
Alien,Alien is my signature fragrance since I never fail to receive compliments when wearing it. I have the 2oz bottle on my vanity and an engraved 1oz that goes in my purse. The refill is so handy for making sure I never run low on this seductive scent.,5,Sephora,us
Alien,Very strong and long staying power. The other day I got into a cab and the driver actually asked me to write down the name of the perfume so he can get it for his wife for Christmas. I love it! To me it almost smells like grapes..kinda.,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"To my nose, this scent is really complex. When I first spray it, I get the grape-ish note, but when it dries down, it's a completely different scent. I could see how one could overdo with application-- it's got staying power. I think this will be my Winter 2012 scent! Although I usually err on the side of under-applying fragrance, I have still gotten several compliments when wearing Alien. I always LOVED Angel, but for some reason it didn't smell the same on me as it did on others. This one works a lot better for me. And, for those of you that collect bottles, this one is beautiful!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I was so thrilled to finally get this perfume! But right when I sprayed it on I literally started gagging, I had to wash it off asap and when that didn't work I had to hit the shower. The smell made my stomach turn. It smelled like sour milk to me. I wish I was kidding. Just please try this before you buy.",1,Sephora,us
Alien,"I was really looking forward to trying this fragrance, but it is unfortunately not for me. I really dig the woodsy aspect to it, but I keep getting the whiff of baby powder that just ruins it for me.",3,Sephora,us
Alien,It's amazing.. I can't describe the smell but EVERYONE should own it. :D,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"This smells like it could be good, but the woody, earthy notes are too much. It reminds me of, and sort of smells like moss and dirt, not the sexy woody earthy smell I was expecting. It smells kind of like I rubbed dirt and wet bark on my skin. Ugh, really wish I would not have put this on right after my shower tonight. The one thing I'm happy about is that this was a sample, and I do love receiving samples so I can try before I buy--even if its a miss for me. I did love the flowerbomb sample though--and I just ordered a full size bottle thanks to being able to sample it first.",1,Sephora,us
Alien,"I love it, because my husband always love this parfum ^^ so sexy smell",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I've been sniffing for a new winter scent and I've come across this one a few times recently. I got a sample the other day and was really liking it, and thought my husband would, too. However, I had to prod him for his opinion, and he finally said, ""It's ok, but it smells like men's cologne."" ???!!!! What the...I was seriously disappointed. To me, it smelled very warm, sexy, and exactly what I thought a winter scent should smell like. I almost want to disregard his opinion and add it to my Christmas list, anyway. ;) I guess it does smell a tad woodsy, which is maybe why he thought that (but I love woodsy smells). Anyway, I did debate knocking it down one star because unfortunately, it doesn't last very long on me! Which is quite contrary to most of the other posts on here. I was disappointed about that, too. :( However, I can't really fault Thierry for my chemistry. Overall though, lovely scent.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"This is the Best scent Ever!!! It is long lasting and I mean long lasting and not overpowering at all. To sum it up, it's Sexy and Sultry. I get tons of Compliments on a daily basis! I highly recommend it and you will definitely not be disappointed :0)",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I'm terrible at describing perfume and scent, but I first received a sample of Alien somewhere around 2007, and it stayed on my mind until I finally bought the 2 oz. bottle this year.

I don't like floral smells, and I like this this scent is darker and unusual. It's also extremely long-lasting. If you spritz some on your clothes, they will keep the scent for several days. This is expensive perfume, as most perfumes are, but you hardly have to use any. One spray, and that's it. As long as you keep it out of sunlight, it should last for years. This is a heavy fragrance, and I can't wear it to work, but even though I don't have many opportunities to wear it, I absolutely love it. I waited years to buy it, and I think it was worth it.

I used a promotion code along with my purchase to also get a sample lotion, shower gel, and travel-size perfume, all in the Alien scent. I use the shower gel occasionally when I really want to wear a scent but are unable to wear the perfume. Scented lotion irritates my skin, and the scent has actually seeped out of the lotion bottle and now permeates the entire drawer I was keeping it in, which is slightly irritating. I might try the lotion on less sensitive areas such as my upper arms or chest, but I don't think I'll use it often. There's also no way you could use the lotion and perfume at the same time without it being completely overwhelming.",4,Sephora,us
Alien,"Out of this world!! warm, clean, and intoxicating. it is like no other perfume i've ever smelled. The staying power is epic, blows all others out of the water. i got the smallest size, but i imagine it'll take a while to run out.... but when i do, i ill be buying the refill. this perfume does not disappoint! -happy customer :)",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"Tried a sample of Alien and couldn't throw it away fast enough. It smells like industrial strength bug spray mixed with a heaping help of old lady smell. Sheesh, this stuff was so bad. Granted, I know everyone's preference of fragrance varies, but man-try a sample before you buy a bottle.",1,Sephora,us
Alien,One of my favorites! This perfume has such a unique smell too it and is long lasting I spray 2 sprays in the morning and people still comment on how good I smell. Such a sexy seductive scent! I think can be worn year round also!,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"This perfume gives justice to its name. I haven't smelled anything like it, and I don't think I'll ever will. My boyfriend loves it! It's different, daring and sexy. The sillage is incredible!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"Recently, I had become enthralled with this perfume. I love the story, the bottle, and of course, the scent! The only minor problem with this perfume is that I feel it doesn't last all day on me. By the end of the day I can just slightly pick up the scent, so only a person standing right next to me can smell it but I don't mind because thats how perfume is supposed to be; only the people close to you can smell it, not the whole room. On me, the scent develops into vanilla and what I'm guessing is the jasmine although some people say they smell orchid but that's not in the notes. I've received countless compliments on this and I love that it's sexy and alluring but also sophisticated and powerfully chic. Like another reviewer said, you feel like a goddess when wearing this...an extra terrestrial, powerful, sensual goddess. It's worth it to purchase the 2oz bottle because it's a classic scent that you will never get tired of looking at or smelling like. Another plus is if the bottle is ever damaged, you can register it when you first purchase it on the Therry Mugler website and the bottle or broken piece will be replaced. If you are still hesitant on smelling it, just spray it or ask for a sample, which Sephora occasionally has. This is my absolute favorite scent!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I LOVE Angel, and I thought Alien smelled nice from the bottle but I am wearing it today and have found myself almost gagging. Does not smell good on me :( returning it ASAP!",1,Sephora,us
Alien,I love this perfume hands down one of my greatest loves in the perfume world. I was so happy to get this and i wore it nonstop however I discovered it makes my boyfriend sneeze all the time when i wear it he is allergic to something in it I am unsure what but it broke my heart to have to return it I still hold onto my little tester I have in my purse though and if he is going to be away for awhile I spray and enjoy,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I tried this because I am a fan of Angel... this could be called ""Dark Angel"" instead of Alien. Where Angel is soft and pretty, Alien is strong and sexy. I feel like a goddess when I wear it. I Love it and you will too!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I love the scent! It's definetely a different type of perfume but also seems to change as it drys down. This is for sure for a person who is a bit more on the dominate side in personality.
I would recommend to go to store and test out before commiting to the pricey price tag.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I bought this for a friend, because it reminded me of her. Like a comic book heroine from the sun! Anyway.... I also couldn't resist purchasing for her when there was a nice little gift set that came with purchase for me to try. I'm not sure it's ME, but I am falling in love with it more every day.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,Interesting but far too sweet and grape (Ish). It does have jasmine tones but wears too delicate on me.,3,Sephora,us
Alien,"Every woman has their favorite, sigunature scent. This is mine! :) I absolutely love everything about it: femenine, sexy, long lasting, not overpowering, elegant. As the description says ""the fragrance exudes a positive energy"", the second I put in on, it puts me in a good mood! Deserves 10 stars!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"After reading the rave reviews on Sephora, I had to go to the store and take it for a test spin. Glad I did. I absolutely LOVE this scent. It really is unusual and there is nothing quite like it. For me, the initial notes reminded me of grape soda. Sweet but not obtrusive. I continued to browse around the store to let the fragrance settle a bit on my skin. The second whiff revealed something not quite so nice. It kind of reminded me of truck tires! It was very bizarre. But wait for it......my final whiff exposed the most hypnotic and intoxicating aroma of jasmine. I was sold. The final test was my husband's blood hound sense of smell. He usually hates most of my perfumes but he actually liked this one. This scent definitely needs some time to settle in so don't make any snap judments. Give it a little time. You won't be disappointed. It should also be noted that a little goes a long way. A little dab will do ya! Enjoy : )",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I was on a cruise off the Greek Islands, My luggege was lost!The girl on the ship sold me this perfume, she said I should have the best. So every time I where the perfume it takes me back to the Greek Island! Love It! and I always get complements....",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I love this perfume! If you're all about sexy and sophisticated scents and longevity then you will love this too! I think the description listed truly fits, it is radiant and mysterious. Plus the bottle is lovely as well!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"Very INTOXICATING, it's true. Like no other. Theatrical, heavy and dragging as the curtains reveal the stage.
However, it is named really aptly ""Alien"" as the notes feel very artificial. ""Solar energy"" and ""from elsewhere"" define this scent accurately, but I must disagree with ""soft and rich as the caress of cashmere,"" as there is nothing soothing about this extraterrestrial drama of a scent.

It makes an unforgettable entrance to be sure, and might be lovely to smell on someone else in passing for a minute or two, but I cannot wear this animal skin as it feels too ""Gathaca"" for my tastes.

Now THIS would be a perfect Lady Gaga's perfume.",4,Sephora,us
Alien,"Wowzers. Let's get the obvious out of the way: this packaging is stunning. It's a bonus that it can be refilled. But the scent...incredible. This has become my favorite; it is complex and unique. I was amazed when I was reading reviews that so many women (and their men, apparently) were so unanimous in loving this, I bought it off the website as a splurge. I love it so much, and it is really hard to explain. The great thing is that the likelihood of you *not* liking this product is very slim, and if you don't, then Sephora has an awesome return policy!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I want this so much! It's so different, such a unique, sexy, fresh scent. It just gets better smelling the longer it's on.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"Whenever I smell this scent, I can imagine in my mind a tall, powerful, and sexy woman. This perfume is really well made, because while I can smell most of the individual notes if I really concentrate, when combined they create this scent that is just amazing and different from anything else. It's a little musky, floral, and has a lot of Jasmine in it. I'm usually not into Jasmine, but when combined with the Amber, Vanilla, and the other notes, it's not overpowering to me.
If by Alien, Thierry Mugler meant to capture the essence of a ""Sexy, Unattainable Woman"" then they did their job right! I can't help but feel sexy and alluring wearing this scent. But be warned, those who like sweet, light, fresh, or sugary scents will not like this at all.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I loved this perfume and I was shocked because I do not care for Angel, the sister scent.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"This is my go-to perfume for dinner parties, dinner with my boyfriend, parties, any nighttime activities. I have other light perfumes that I switch off for daytime, but this reigns supreme for evening. One thing I've found is that men LOVE this scent. I once had a stranger ask me what I was wearing so he could buy it for his girlfriend. When my boyfriend and I have dinner plans or are going to a party, he says ""Are you going to wear the purple alien perfume?"" and he cannot get enough of it, finding excuses to get near my neck. I'm pretty sensitive to heavy fragrances and perfumes that are powdery or floral typically make me queasy. I'd call this ""dark"" rather than ""heavy"" because it's not overpowering, but it definitely seems more appropriate for nighttime. It's just warm, sensual and spicy, and has a wonderful drydown. (I love it when I wear it with a coat or scarf and then smell the collar a couple of days later and it's still lingering a bit.) Everyone I know seem to just love this fragrance.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,I LOVE this scent!!! I have a friend who works at Sephora and she made me a sample....the hubby got a whiff and bought me the bottle (It helps when you sleep with Santa!) It is so sexy and intoxicating.....I have a new signature scent!! I can't imagine ever tiring of it! It's fantastic!!,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"i loveeee this perfume! i got a sample of it and fell in love...it just screams sexy. i was going to buy it but thought it was too expensive but i bought it anyway.... i am so glad i got it. it smells soo good, like mature, sexy, complex, mysterious, sultry, seductive......its true!!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,I love this perfume I smelled a sample in Cosmo latina and I told myself to wait but I couldn't so I went ahead and purchased it a few days later. It is a very sexy seductive scent...I couldnt resist it made me fall in love with myself,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"This is a very strong and adult scent. It goes on sort of spicy and warm and then mellows out into a more floral and powdery scent. It's probably best for night, but I'll wear it out during the day anyway.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I was addicted to Angel, my boyfriend refilled my bottle for my birthday last year at Nordstrom, and while he was waiting he smelled Alien and loved it. He also bought me a small bottle at the time, I have been wearing it ever since even more than my signature scent, Angel, I get so many compliments on it!!!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I had been searching for a change from my usual perfumes. Did not like this initially on the test strip. Tried it out on my skin anyway and it started to smell pretty amazing after a bit of time went by. I had to have it, and went back to buy it. I have never really felt this way about any other perfume, but this is unlike any other I have smelled.. It is very unique, complex and beautiful (don't really care for the name though). It even got me a compliment on an important date ;) I prefer to use this at night/on colder days though. The one downside is that it wears off on me for some reason in about 4-5 hours, so I have to reapply. It seems to have been long lasting on others though. Expensive, but still think it is so worth buying! It is probably not for everyone, but definitely give it a try!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I went shopping for a new signature scent. Came home with some samples and asked for my husbands preference. He hated them all, complained they all smelled like something his grandma would wear. So we went shopping together. As soon as he got a hint of this on me, he LOVED it, and so did I. I bought some and couldn't stop smelling my wrist on the way home! The scent is almost indescribable, warm and feminine but sensual. It seems to change and just gets better as the day goes on. And it lasts... In the morning I could still smell it. By far my favorite fragrance!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"honestly, i havent heard about Thierry Mugler before. but when i was on vacation in Paris i was given a free sample in Sephora. and i didnt like it, i loved it. the next day i came back and bought this fragrance. it so seductive and sweet, i really adore it. moreover, its my favourite smell at the moment)",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"Angel is intriguing on the right person, though the dewberry in it is that ""skunky"" smell. Now Alien with it's naughty jasmine is the scent for me! Once it dries down, it developes a good ""worn in"" quality on the skin and lasts a long time. I like that this scent teases the senses...not assaults them. Smells like how a woman should smell but better. It reminds me of two fragrances that I can no longer get. Like that it's refillable too.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"This one I'd definitely recommend trying on at the store and walking around with it on. (It smells nothing like Angel)

Alien is quite polarizing for people. Some people can rock it, some can't. It's not the kind of perfume that anyone can spray on and go. (And no I'm not trying to sound like a snob, fragrances in general can be that way, just many of the popular ones are easily worn by everyone...)
.

Anyway...

This has become my signature scent. It can be a little strong sometimes, but it ""melts"" nicely into the skin when applied carefully. When I wear this, people know I'm in a room, or have been in one, in a good way.

It's one of the few perfumes I own, and one of the few I need to own.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,This is the most magical thing you will ever smell. It's seductive and perfect. Btw I call this one the smell of London cz you would smell it on everyone over there. I love it if I could I would rate it with 20 stars.,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I have a problem with fragrances not asting on me. I recently bought Jennifer Ansiton and Coach Signature, and although I liked the fragrances, they only lasted about a half hour on me, so they were returned. Alien is one of the longest lasting. It reminds me of Dior's Poison, but lighter. There was a perfume made by Yves Rocher called Shafali, which has been discontinued, and this smells almost exactly like it, but lasts longer. I love the bottle. Will Sephora be offering refills?",4,Sephora,us
Alien,"LOVE this fragrance!! I has become my new signature scent. Feminine, very delicate, not the least bit overpowering, and sexy all in one. love it!!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"Wow, beautiful. If you like jasmine, you must get this... it showcases jasmine in the most beautiful way I've ever smelled in a fragrance. A lot of people say this smells like grape soda, and it does have a sweet grapey-ness. I like it because it's slightly dark and unusual, but it's still soft and feminine. It won't offend anyone like Angel does. Love this!!!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,I actually returned this because the store display was very unclear and I bought the refill. I actually mix Alien with another fragrance. It smells amazing.,4,Sephora,us
Alien,"I've gotten nothing but compliments when wearing this perfume...(my chemistry usually doesn't allow me to wear many fragrances, so that's amazing in itself.) Subtle but lasting. This fragrance can be worn for both casual and evening.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"Every two or so years, I buy a new ""signature fragrance"". I am always drawn to warm, floral-oriental perfumes, so naturally I gravitated towards a Thierry Mugler fragrance, which are known for their notes of jasmine.
I was just browsing, honestly. I had no intention of buying a new perfume- I have been mixing D&G The One with IDOLE d'Armani, and I was perfectly content with doing that for another year or so.
In the store, I went directly for Angel, which is a beautiful scent, and I know so many women who wear it. I wanted to get a sample of it, but before I flagged anyone down, I saw the Alien bottle sitting beside the Angel bottle. I was intrigued; the bottle reminds me of an amethyst, and the name stood out to me (it's hard to read the name on the 1 oz. bottle, if you look at it, but I knew that TM had a fragrance called Alien). I sprayed it on myself, liked it immediately, but I was only in the store for samples. I got a tiny plastic sample bottle filled and left the store.
I went to another store afterwards, and had almost totally put the fragrance out of my mind as I was trying on clothes in the fitting rooms. But, an hour after I left the store, as I was putting my clothes back on... I was hit with the fragrance again.
I practically fainted. I closed my eyes, gripped my sweater in my hands, and buried my face into it. The fragrance had dried down into the most intoxicating scent to ever hit my nose, and I was instantly in love. My friends were still mulling about in the dressing rooms, and I rushed over to them and exclaimed, ""I smell like heaven. I'm going back to Sephora."" I did. I went back, grabbed the smallest bottle I could find, and prayed that I had enough money on my card to buy it.
Now bear in mind, I am NOT an impulsive person. I sometimes think about a purchase for months before actually going to the store for it. I'm frugal and conservative. This was the first ""impulse buy"" I have ever committed. I did not have enough money on my debit card to buy it, so I did something shocking: I used my bank card to buy it. Yes, my bank card, that I have never used in the year I've had it and only keep in case of emergencies like getting my car towed or replacing my computer. But I don't regret it. In my mind, this was an emergency.
That's the end of my rant about HOW I got the perfume. Sorry it was so long. I felt it necessary to convey the effect it had on me. Now here's my review:

It opened on a very green note with the jasmine (probably why I merely liked it at first... I don't do green fragrances...), it was very crisp and lady-like. Alien's true colors were revealed through the dry-down, though. The scent stayed very mature and sophisticated, but the green plant-like notes morphed into an oriental scent, with a beautiful amber and cashmeran that is so unique. A ton of fragrances boast these notes but always smell cheap and commercial to me. In Alien, these warm notes were so pure. It smells exquisite and expensive. It smells like what I imagine female billionaires would wear to a charity gala.
The staying power of this perfume is phenomenal. Most perfumes linger on my skin for about an hour before they completely fade away. This stayed on for about eight hours before it was gone.
The best thing about it though is its intensity. It didn't hover around me like a cloud all day like most stronger scents do. It did not overpower me. It's a scent that you have to be very close to it to smell, which is a big must for me. I don't want anyone to smell me except for the person sitting directly next to me. However, once you're close to it, it hits you in gentle, pleasant waves.
My friends and my parents immediately complimented me on it. I noticed strangers trying to smell me discretely. When my boyfriend hugged me, he noticed it- and that's a big deal, considering the fact that he doesn't notice whether I've shaved or not.

The gist is, it's flawless. It's very unique and lasting, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a scent that will get you noticed. It's unlike any other perfume out there. I'm officially obsessed.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,I am a perfume QUEEN and this has become my new favorite. I wear it everyday. It smells wonderful and is not too over-powering.,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I am in love with this perfume. I really wanted to like angel also, but on me the patchouli is too overpowering. Alien just smells better to me also. It's not really comparable to any other perfumes that I have smelled...the jasmine note is amazing. I feel TM's perfumes are very sophisticated, and maybe I am a little to young for it. But I love it nevertheless! My boyfriend loves it also. Oh, and you really save a lot of money buy purchasing this bottle rather than the 1oz for this price. I just fill my atomizer with it and I'm good to go!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I love this perfume it is unique, feminine and sexy. I read another reviewer stated it made her want to smell her wrists all day and I am very guilty of that when I wear this fragrance. I try to rotate my scents according to mood but have a hard time not wearing ths one everyday!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I love fragrances. Over the years, I have tried MANY. However, this is my all-time favorite. I love that it is unique, long-lasting, and very sensual. Men go crazy for it. I was hesitant to write a review, because I don't want other people wearing it. Lol. Buy it. You won't regret it.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,I get a lot of compliments when I wear this perfume.,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I stumbled across this fragrance in my sample draw, I saw the name and ""Alien"" popped out at me. I sprayed it on, and was hooked. The next day I went straight to Sephora and purchased it. This scent is amazing, and as it says at the top, has now become one of my signature scents. When people smell this they know it's me LOL. It's great because it lasts all day! I'm serious, like 10 hours. Now, when you first spray it on, it smells sort of strong and a little weird. After maybe 5 mins, it changes, it is a powerful scent though, but not like a choking one. I just love this scent and it it very distinctive.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"Have received so many compliments on this perfume from men and women. Have been asked by strangers what perfume I'm wearing: random woman at a party, shopper in grocery store, co-worker, and barista in starbucks. For a person who likes a distinctive, enveloping, enigmatic and sensuous perfume and is looking to attract characters of a similar personality.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I first tried Alien when I got a sample of it a few years ago. I love perfumes and buy a lot of them because I like to change up my scents, but for some reason I kept postponing buying this one.

I bought myself a bottle of this right before Christmas and I don't know why I waited so long. This scent is hard to classify, but it smells mysterious and wonderful somehow. The name Alien fits it well because the smell is just different than most other fragrances I own. This is one of those fragrances where you want to keep smelling your wrists all day long.

The scent lasts a long time and you don't need much. The bottle is also beautiful!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"This was a Christmas gift from mi husband. i wasn't sure if I like it or not but i decide to keep it. The first day I wore it , the very first day, I receive a complement. And the next one and the next one... Now its my favorite for winter and I will buy it again. It is absolutely beautiful , luxurious, sexy, seductive, sensual fragrance. Long Lasting too. Very different ,unique smell. I can't say enough about Alien. It is expensive but but worth the money. Give it a try. One of the best fragrances in my collection, Thanks baby I love you even more!!!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,My patient who was getting radiation therapy treatments introduced me to this fragrance and I've been wearing it ever since!! She was from another country and I had never heard of Alien! Now my mother loves it as well...every time I wear it I get compliments especially from MEN!!!,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"Wonderful fragrance, scent lasts a very long time, it goes a very long way because you don't need too spray much.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,I love this stuff and the refill bottle is a huge $$ saver. definitely the way to go if you wear this on a regular basis.,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"Neither cold nor warm, neither feminin nor masculin, neither romantic nor innocent. Only brilliant and fascinating, in a mysterious way.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,very intense sensory experience....people say I dont know that fragrance but its great on you,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"This smells so good. A little goes along way, its not overpowering though and it smells good on you the next day. Its hard to explain this scent but it just smells so good!!!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"This perfume is amazing, I am always getting complements when I wear it -from men, women, strangers, everyone! It is very sexy but feminine at the same time, a warm floral. It lasts all day and you only need one spritz and you're good. Definitely one of those scents that people will recognize you by-they catch a whiff and think of you. I really feel like its ""my scent"".",5,Sephora,us
Alien,I cant stop sniffing myself. This is a very unique perfume and i would say that Mugler chose an apt name for it. Very supernatural and Addictive quality to it....will definitely intensify those traits,5,Sephora,us
Alien,best perfume. everyone compliments me on the fragrance.,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I'm loving this perfume. Everytime I wear it people ask me ""WOW what's that smell? I'm getting it too""",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I recommend smelling this in store before buying. Its a very unique fragrance. I think that if you like Dolce Gabanna light blue, then you would possibly like this too. I bought it as a gift for my sister and she loves it.",4,Sephora,us
Alien,There is something in here that makes it super appealing to guys. It's strong without being headache inducing. Smells warm yet clean.,5,Sephora,us
Alien,I ALWAYS get compliment when I wear this perfume. I LOVE it!!,5,Sephora,us
Alien,BEST FRAGRANCE EVER!!!,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I had a sample of this perfume and initially I wasn't impressed. I needed to let it dry down and after 30 minutes I came back to smell it and I was in love. This fragrance is beautiful - for work or play. It's a unique scent and you will be hard pressed to find other women wearing this scent. It's clean and soft...I can't help but my smell my wrists whenever I wear it. This is a perfume that you need to ""walk into"". Lightly spray this on just one to two times. You'll find it lasts a long time!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"This is ok, but a little too ""traditional"" for me. Also, it's quite a heavy scent. I got it as a sample and wouldn't purchase it for myself. It feels like something better suited to my mother or grandmother.",3,Sephora,us
Alien,"You know that feeling of excitement, when cool, night air rolls over your skin and you look-up at the stars, content that at 3 years old or 100, it's always acceptable to maintain a child-like sense of awe and wonder over the vastness of Space, stars, The Universe? ""Alien"" is that feeling, conjured-up and stored in a bottle. It's, equal parts, nostalgic and futuristic; cozy and distant. It feels almost self-consciously artificial, but that artificiality is a distinct part of its charm.

On opening, I smell this series of notes, in interweaving layers: Cherry menthol, skin musk, pistachio, ""windex"", waxy gardenia and jasmine petals, velvetine, coffee, sand, salt and other minerals. The jasmine is almost completely perfect and feels chilled, like an ideal specimen being stored for further study. The ""sand"" note is soft and cozy and reminds me of a gentle breeze blowing over a sand dune covered in evening dew; the perfect temperature of a summer night, as I swing in a hammock under the stars. It does have that strange contrast of temperature, like that of a summer night; cool air and a cozy sweater, sunlight peaking over the horizon of a dusty, chilled moon. That ""sand dune"" note is what gives ""Alien"" its interstellar ""moonscape"" quality.

While the musk feels warm and intimate, it never feels humid or balmy -- this is dusky, sunbaked skin, cooling under The Night Sky, as the first stars come out. The drydown is the most accessible part, as a soft, cedar, linen and vetiver-like hum, balances the blend, softening any crisp edges, into a sweet, uniformly sheer veil.

When I heard Theirry Mugler was inspired by 1950's ""Pulp Comics"" while constructing his scents, I couldn't believe how perfectly he's communiated this aesthetic. There's a distinctly retro-kitsch sensibility in his scents that's delightfully artificial; artificial in that these are quirky works of art, designed and created to not mimic something ""real"", but to tell really interesting stories. As a result, these scents defy trends and fads and it's hard to pin them down to a specific era; they feel retro and modern, at the same time. And ""Alien"" is the best example of this. It's a wacky, unique little number, that can't be copied -- frozen cherry-coke in a 50's convertable, watching ""Monster vision"" movies at a drive-in. Or it could be a 90's film, imitating all of that. It's one of a kind.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,This is my favorite. This scent is so unique and leaves a soft and sexy aroma. It is long lasting and perfect!,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"This is the last fragrance you will ever want to wear,",5,Sephora,us
Alien,I wish the world was covered in this perfume! It has the perfect blend of spice and sweet. I can't get enough of this scent! Even the bottle is cool!,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I cannot get enough of this perfume, it is sooooooooooooo awesome.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,I have had sooo many people ask me what I was wearing. Compliments galore!,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"Well what can i say the bottle and smell speaks for itself, II get tons of compliments when i wear this fragrance, its a very pretty smell, hard to describe, I love this sooo much that i must have bought 5 bottles withing the last 6 months.. just making sure i never run out ,,,",5,Sephora,us
Alien,Simply amazing!!! It's a must buy.,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I set out to find my ""Signature Scent"". I'm going into college in the fall, and I wanted something unique. After a few misses, and maybes I tried this. I put it on one wrist and wore it around the mall all day, at the end of the day I decided to go with it. It was still strong despite sweating, and running around, and while it smelled like Alien, it had mingled with my body's chemistry, and became something even more beautiful.

I wanted something that smelt like me, I didn't want to smell like it. I got that with this perfume.

It may not be for everyone though. It's pretty strong, and heavy, which is part of what I love about it. I was honestly a little shocked to see it described as floral on here. I wouldn't suggest buying as a gift for someone unless they know and love it. Definitely try it out first.

Bottom line: I love it, but it's not for everyone.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I could not believe the first day I wore this a guy literally followed me and then he was like ""what are you wearing?"" I told him and he was like oh my g** that smells so fantastic. I was like thank you. I am so stocking up on this fragrance!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"This is my favorite perfume! I got the 2 oz. bottle for Christmas last year but my mother liked it so much, I gave it to her and have been using the samples that came with it. I finally decided I need a bottle. I got the 1 oz. bottle (yes, it is refillable!).

It is a unique scent and there's just something so alluring about it. ""Alien"" is definitely a fitting name. And I love the design of the bottle - it's edgy yet pretty and the color purple accurately represents this fragrance.

My co-worker, whom I share an office with, has complimented me on this perfume, and like other reviewers have mentioned, it is a man magnet. My close female cousin once commented, ""Wow, you smell so good, you smell so womanly!""

It is quite strong so I find that one spray is enough. It's also very long-lasting. So, you are getting your money's worth.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I've bought this perfume several times and LOVE it. I don't think you can go wrong with it, I get compliments on it all the time.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I did not know about this fragrance, when I received a sample in a magazine. I did some research and discovered the name of the person who invented it Thierry Mugler. I was so happy! This was a search that altogether was several months. It was totally worth it! I wear it most of the time.",4,Sephora,us
Alien,The refill bottle contains a tiny bit more than the real bottle can hold so pour carefully and don't overfill!,5,Sephora,us
Alien,I love Alien. It's very unique and always gets attention. People always stop me to ask what fragrance I'm wearing. That has never happened with any other fragrance.,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"This is one of the three scents that are currently on my bathroom counter - right beside Chanel Chance Eau Tendre (perfect summer, citrus, gentle scent) and Dior Hypnotic Poison (caramel apples and jasmine, mmm). The jasmine is what attracts me to Alien, I absolutely adore jasmine. The perfume is long-lasting and smells even better on my skin. My boyfriend absolutely loved it. It is complex and beautiful, and can be worn by younger women - but it is definitely not a little girl perfume. The bottle is gorgeous, the scent is phenomenal - I went into Sephora looking for a light floral, but I tried Alien because I had read good reviews of it (in case you can't tell by my review, I adored it). I think that two sprays and one on the wrists works wonderfully. It's expensive, but worth it. And refillable? Genius.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I have tried many, many different perfumes over the years. This is, hands down, my favorite. For someone who doesn't hold a scent well, this is a great choice. It lasts all day. I even chose this perfume to wear on my wedding day - my husband loves it!! A few co-workers even went out and bought it after I started wearing it. Great choice!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I love Alien! I know a lot of people say that this is for cooler temps, but this works for summer too. It can be very fresh and kind of fruity. It seems to change with the temperature. It lasts forever too! I can smell it the next morning! My husband has always loved Angel on me, but he said Alien is his favorite second.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I love Thierry Mugler perfumes, and I love trying out new ones. While I absolutely love this fragrance--it is unusual and alluring, it doesn't last after the dry-down. I'm glad that a friend gave me a sample to try before I spent money on a full-size bottle! If you are one of those people who DOESN'T have a problem with a fragrance lasting, then try this!",4,Sephora,us
Alien,"You just have to smell it! I heard about it from one of beauty gurus on Youtube, and out of curiosity smelled in Macys. It is so amazing, I just can't stop smelling my skin. It is definitely more for cooler/evening times.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"Smells just like my mom. This is her favorite perfume. Sometimes when I walk around my house I get a whiff of it lingering...and it makes me happy. I went with her when she purchased this and we had a wonderful time. I love my mom so much, she's my best friend.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"It's one of my top favorites! I really recommend it if you're looking for a outstanding and very unique frangance! Also it lasts for hours on my skin...
I live here and there between the US and Brazil so I confess that I don't wear it in Brazil very often, cause in my opinion this fragance is pretty strong for the hot weather and I would rather wear something more fresh! But whenever I'm in the US (and it's cold) I wearn it all the time, it's amazing, I always receive a complement and my fiance loves it too!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I just love the fresh scent of Alien, its crisp , young and truly amazing",5,Sephora,us
Alien,It's pretty strong so I save it for special nights out/in with my boyfriend who loves it too ;),5,Sephora,us
Alien,Sweet floral. Not a floral fragrance fan but has sweet notes. Only need one spray and maybe one on wrists. Very powerful. Lasts all day. Always get great compliments. Yes it is pricey but like I said only need one maybe 2 sprays. Nice spring/summer fragrance.,5,Sephora,us
Alien,Sexy and unique. Will draw attention from both sexes. Amazing fragrance.,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"This fragrance lasts. My daughter said I smelled so good when I returned home at 9:00pm and this way my day...I put Alien on after my morning shower - had a full day on a college campus tour in and out of the rain all day - hour long shuttle ride to the airport and then a 2 hour flight home. My daughter's compliment made me realize, this fragrance is a winner.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I tried the body lotion and pefume at the same time to really get a sense for what this perfume is like. It is very different from the other 3 Mugler perfumes I have tried. The others (Angel, womanity, innocent<--i think that's what it's called) are very unique/offensive to some and strong. This one is soft, feminine, and would probably appeal to many age groups and a lot more women. I think the description that Sephora gives for this fragrance is very accurate. It is the kind of perfume that appeals to people w/out trying to hard. I would consider this as a future purchase. Good for anytime of year or occassion.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,I really love this pefume. Use it daily :),5,Sephora,us
Alien,Every time I wear Alien I receive a compliment from someone. It's a unique scent that lifts your spirit whenever you wear it.,5,Sephora,us
Alien,Love it !! Great smell not overpowering . Very sexy and feminine,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"This perfume is amazing. It is so unique to each woman's chemistry. I've been asked by men and women what perfume i'm wearing. Very intriguing, captivating fragrance.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"love love love love!!!!
I get comments and compliments on this scent all the time.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,My husband bought this for me a year ago...I had to buy another bottle. The perfume is amazing...hints of grape and vanilla....by far the best perfume I have every owned.,5,Sephora,us
Alien,I have angel and thought I would try this..It too is soo overpowering and only need one small spritz and it lasts all day. It smells a little lighter but still strong. I cant place it but I wouldnt call it a floral or soft floral like the description says. It is very spicy and definately smells better after it dries down.,4,Sephora,us
Alien,"This scent is just like the title, exciting. It's nothing Ive ever smelt before, and its very sweet and sexy and even a little bit spicey. To me it smells like grape a little bit? Maybe thats the fruity bits. Anyway, I strongly recomend trying this perfume.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I received this as a gift for Christmas this year. I was hesitant that it would be too strong and overwhelming, since many ""heavy"" scents give me a headache. I am happy to say that this is a great, big win. While strong at first, it quickly dries down into a warm, spicy, feminine scent with forward notes of vanilla and musk on me. Since it is a rather strong perfume, I am careful to not overdo it, and have asked people around me if I've overdone it. So far, so good!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I love the body lotion as the scent is not as intense/heavy as the perfume. It lasts all day and even when I no longer smell it I get compliments on the scent. I find it spicy, woodsy and sexy.
I prefer it to Angel.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"After reading all these good reviews about this perfume I asked my husband to buy it for me as a Christmas Gift, and... he did :) I fell in love with it instantly. It's going to be my new signature perfume from now on. I sprayed only once and went to the store for shopping, and guess what? 3 people (ladies) came up to me and asked me what I was wearing. I smiled and said ""Alien"" So when other reviews said that people will stop you and ask you about the perfume, they were RIGHT! I love, love the scent and let me tell you this - I sprayed twice today at 2pm and now it's 11pm and I still smell the perfume on me :) It's worth every penny ladies...
PS. I was looking for the ""right"" perfume for me, because I love the ones who stays on me for a long time and this one does it's job!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I have received SO many compliments on this perfume. I'm a very picky perfume junkie, and this is my all-time favorite. My entire class (including the teacher) spent the whole period trying to figure where a mysterious scent came from. Someone finally just decided to sniff me, and the next thing I knew, every single boy was around me and sniffing me. They all bought it for their girlfriends and I always receive compliments. I also just love the bottle. One spray on the neck is just enough to last all day.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"When I first spray this fragrance on, I had a hard time breathing. It was extremely strong. After a few hours it became very warm and quite nice. This girl at work said she could smell me from across the hall. (not sure if that was a good thing). When I got home about ten hours later, I could still smell this fragrance on my clothes and my skin. I decided to try it again, but this time only one spray. And what a difference! It was amazing! Note to self: A little goes a long way. No need to re apply it.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,I feel very sexy when wearing my Alien perfume.,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I first got this perfume a few years ago when I turned 16, hoping that it'd be more mature and 'mysterious' than Vera Wang Princess and a little more edgy than Miss Dior Cherie. I got more than my money's worth. I felt sexy putting this scent on, and so did other people. Strangers would smell me and tell me I smelled amazing. The first few months I wore it, before people adjusted to it, I got around 10 compliments a day at school. Guys liked it so much on me that they got it for their girlfriends. It's a masterpiece. It smells different on everyone though, so be cautioned that it might not smell the same on you as it does on the person you smelled it on. Definately give it a try though.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I am a seventeen year old girl working as a grocery store cashier and every time that I wear Alien I am asked what on earth I am wearing, people are mesmerized by this incredible scent. Alien has an ability to capture and demand someones attention while staying as sublime and reserved as the person wearing it. This scent is truly magic.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"AMAZING! First had a sample from ELLE, so bought this slightly more expensive eau de perfume. So worth it. I spray twice on my neck in the morning and I can still smell it by night! People actually stopped to ask what the smell was, I was more than happy to tell them =)",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I am so happy I got the big one cuz I know I will finish this soon and will be able to refill it with a lower price .
this Perfume smells so good OMG it smells better than chanel and anything else. LOVE IT",5,Sephora,us
Alien,It's wonderful--great to perk up your senses on an early morning.,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"After many years of using ANGEL by TM... I have realized... I am better suited for ALIEN by TM
I LOVE it.. and the scent is long lasting and the bottle is beautiful...",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"Alien is a Sexy, Alluring ,Mysterious fragrance. It is geared for a sophisicated woman who doesnt mind standing out in the crowd. Complex but radiates sensuality. Fragrance lasts all day into evening. Very impressed.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I took a chance buying this after only smelling a magazine fragrance strip. Especially after trashing a sample of Angel one time because I hated it. I'm so glad I chanced this one, it may easily become my new favorite fragrance. It's complex and hard to describe. But it isn't the type that will make people in a elevator hate me or gag.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"This parfum is amazing. I was thrown by it when I first tried it because I wasn't quite sure if the notes were coming together in a way that appealed to me. But oh. my. goodness. When they finally settled, it gave the most amazing, glorious scent. This is heaven in a bottle for me. It is strong, but so very feminine, and drys down to the most beautiful, sweet, sexy, and sophisticated floral I've ever smelled. And it LASTS. Just a spritz can scent up a room. But it's not knock-you-down strong. I had this on and put on my scarf, and days later the smell still permeated my scarf with the most incredible scent. This is now my favorite perfume. I discovered it late, but just happy I discovered it. LOVE.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"This scent is FABULOUS!!!!!!!! SO sexy, so fresh - pure sophistication. I get stopped at least a few times a week by women who want to know what perfume I am wearing. Definitely a haute fragrance!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I'm in love with it. Mysterious, sexy. Long lasting. Fresh.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,This is hands down one of my favorite perfumes! Even my hubby adores this sexy scent ;o),5,Sephora,us
Alien,This is the most amazing scent. I wore it a few days ago and I got 5 compliments! People notice it and always say something. Although it is expensive it is worth every penny. I love the clean fresh smell and I don't usually like florals. It only takes a little bit as it is very strong. I highly recommend it. ;o),5,Sephora,us
Alien,"It is hard to say anything about Alien that hasn't already been said. In a world of sugary candy coated perfumes Alien is nothing like the rest. It is soft but demands attention because it will not be ignored! For me it is gothic and erotic in the most positive way. It is the way a vampire would smell as strange as that may sound. Alien is the most beautiful creature you have every laid eyes on or smelt. ""Alien"" such a strange yet perfect name for this intoxicating elixir!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,One of my favorite scents! It's very mysterious and different but in a really good way :),5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I don't think I can compare this to anything, it's fun and bold to me. Youthful and radiant but not child-like in any way.",4,Sephora,us
Alien,GET READY TO TURN HEADS THIS FRAGRANCE IS A MUST HAVE!,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"Very seductive scent, I love it !!!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,SENSUAL AND SULTRY THE ONLY WORDS THAT CAN DESCRIBE THIS FRAGRANCE!,5,Sephora,us
Alien,Love at first smell. I love a great smell and this is one of my favorites. Probably not for everyone but it does it for me.,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"This is the only fragrance I will cheat on Dior Addict with. Love it, the notes change on you. I will never forget a women with her husband in the store was like ""Wow... what are you wearing that's that J. Holiday. Make me want to sing I wanna put my fingers thru your hair
Wrap me up in your legs
And love you till your eyes roll back
I'm tryin to put you to bed, bed, bed."" Lol Every guy I wake pass wearing this couldn't help but look and speak on how great I smell.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"Completely unique...as are all Thierry Mugler fragrances. I don't like wearing what everyone else wears and this hits the mark...sensual, yet not cloying, light, yet not invisible, heady, yet not head-banging!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"Holy moly, love at first smell! I bought this based on the reviews and I just LOVE it!!!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"Where does one begin? This fragrance is extremely feminine and elegant, given its floral base, but is unlike any other floral perfume I have ever tried. It's soft, but very rich--perfect for the women who wishes to be the epitome of rich, sensual elegance. It's also modern and chic, without being excessively floral and pungent like some other perfumes. I have never gone without a compliment without when wearing it, and women of all ages revel in this perfume!
I highly recommend this perfume and will remain loyal to it--it is definitely worth the price.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,I found my personal scent. This is the most amazing perfume. I love his special editions of this as well. The bottles are art.,5,Sephora,us
Alien,This is one of my all time favorite fragrances! Every time i wear it i always have men and women asking what it is! It is so unique and makes you feel so sexy!,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I loooove this perfume. The name was what caught my attention when I was shopping one day at the mall, so I tried it, and it reminded me of grapes, vodka and vanilla haha! The fragrance lasts a long time, I got compliments from two random people that day like three hours later. It's different from any other perfume i've ever smelt, i'm addicted. (: You will be noticed wearing this!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"interesting smell, hubby liked it but by the end of the day i was soooo overwhelmed by the smell because it is soooo strong, too much for me, ok if you like strong heady scents that never soften",4,Sephora,us
Alien,i first spelled this on a friend but never asked her what it was. when i was loooking through her purse for a hair elastic i found it and smelled it and it was what shed been wearing. but i couldnt figure out was the stupid bottle said! then when i got the name i came straight t this sight and ordered it. i must say it got me interested so i think that you should buy it also its such a sweet yet mysterious fragrance.,5,Sephora,us
Alien,this perfume is the best scented i have ever had! it lasts forever which means less sprays which means less wasting and not having to buy more in a long time,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"When I went to purchase this fragrance, the bottles this size were behind a $50 price sign. When I was at the register I was informed my purchase totaled $80. When I asked the associate why it was marked $50, she was confused. Upon further investigation she realized the bottles of fragrance were incorrectly placed where the lotion should have been. Though the associate was friendly and polite, I don't think the situation was handled in the correct way. I paid the $80.00 and was never offered the price that is was currently being advertised for. So this was a poor shopping experience in my opinion. I also think not selling it for the price it was marked at is against the law. However, the fragrance is great and I will continue buying it, perhaps not at THAT location again.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"What can I say! Love, Love, Love this scent! I receive so many compliments from both Men & women when I walk int o a room. Because I layer my scent, the fragrance stays with me a long time and throughout the day & evening. One spriitz of the parfume re-ignites the scent all over again! what a heady and exotic experience.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,I get so many complements on this from men & women. The smell is intoxicating and very distinct. It wears very well &last all day!,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"This fragrance is absolutely amazing and unlike any other I ever smelled. It's seductive, sexy, soothing, and ever so alluring. First the scent of purple flowers enchants the nose, but then a sweetly mysterious smell catches your imagination. So worth the price in my opinion. Many perfumes out there today are a dime a dozen and aren't worth the price listed, but this is totally unique and beautiful. I'd buy again, but the 2 oz bottle is refillable and usually lower than a new bottle.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,This perfume has haunted me since the day I received it as a sample. I have been wearing it for over 3 years now and I just can't seem to get away from it..for me it is some sort of magnetism...i love it...need I say more?,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"This has an addictive smell in the bottle, but as soon as it is sprayed onto skin (on anyone, myself or any of my friends) it becomes totally overwhelming and can clear a room. But it is amazing smelling and lasts for hours.",3,Sephora,us
Alien,"This fragrance is so unique, it makes a great signature scent. It is floral and feminine, but also warm and sexy-so it is good for both day and night. My best friend and a few other women I know wear Alien and after smelling it I just had to have it! Something about it is truly intoxicating, I get complements all the time and it lasts for hours. You can always tell when someone is wearing it- it lingers in a very mysterious and sexy way. I always hate it when fragrances are too strong or in your face, but this not like that.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,So I just ordered this perfume and received it a couple days ago and am absolutely hooked. I have never received so many compliments on a perfume in my life! It makes me feel sexy and wonderfulll!!! I recommend it to everyone! Not to mention.. it lasts for hours!,5,Sephora,us
Alien,Love the perfume. I receive many compliments on it.,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I am sexiest when I am wearing Alien. That is all you need to know when considering this purchase.

....highly recommended.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"This scent gets more comments than any other I own. and I'm a collector! I've been told that its smell is ""haunting"".. men adore it. I like that every now and then I catch a sniff of it, even if its 9 at night and i put it on before work at 8",5,Sephora,us
Alien,I absolutely love this perfume. At first I thought it smelled a bit weird but after wearing it i am in love! I get so many compliments on it and never go out without it :),5,Sephora,us
Alien,"Unique, mysterious, sexy...this perfume is absolutely amazing. My only complaint is that it doesn't seem to last very long.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,Deliciously Seductive. Intense. I think Terry Mugler has struck gold with this one.,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"This is one of my favorite scents, which doesn't mean it's for everyone--try it on your own skin first. It smells slightly different on everyone. If you like it and you have normal/oily skin, this is the perfect summer lotion. It's very light, not creamy, and leaves your skin shimmering. If you have dry skin, I would go with the Alien cream instead of the lotion.",4,Sephora,us
Alien,"Alien is a lovely, very ""safe"" perfume. After testing both the EDP and the Perfume Oil, I settled on the latter. One thing that I enjoy about Thierry Mugler, as a brand, are the divine bath and body products that accompany their best-selling fragrances. Everything from hair mist to rich body creams to oils. The quality of Alien Perfume Oil is superb and it is a beautiful and concentrated way to enjoy the scent of Alien. I find Alien to be extremely soft and rather linear on my skin. Mostly, I get a gorgeous Amber note and a subtle dose of Jasmine. Alien smells a great deal like my Stella McCartney Stella, (which I adore). Yet, as much as I love Stella, it has very little staying power. To my nose and on my skin, Alien is quite similar to Stella, but Alien packs a little more punch and it lasts for hours and hours. All in all, Alien doesn't ""wow"" me, but I like it enough to buy it again. This can be worn effortlessly, day or night, any time of year.",4,Sephora,us
Alien,"Received this for my birthday. It was strong at first but it melts into the skin for a really subtle, seductive scent.
Gorgeous bottle, too!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,I bought this for my mom for mother's day & she absolutely loves it! It is such a unique scent and you can refill it for half the original price!,5,Sephora,us
Alien,strong jasmine scent...i really like it,5,Sephora,us
Alien,Some people posted that this smell was like Angel - just more intense...I do NOT agree with that... However - I LOVE THE SCENT! My new fav,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"When Thierry Mugler set out to create a fragrance completely different and unique from anything, I think he was successful. I really can't compare this with many mainstream fragrances out there because I haven't come across anything that is too similar.

Alien is dark and slightly on the heavier side. I get an overload of jasmine and powdery notes. Something in here also reminds me of corn husks and raw dirt, although they are not listed notes.

I like unique and different at times, but this one just doesn't do it for me. Alien is definitely recommended for those that are looking for something on the different and mysterious side. If you are a fan of perfumes such as Bvlgari's Omnia Green Jade (has jasmine as well) and Kenzo Amour Indian Holi, you may like this, as they share a similar powdery note.",2,Sephora,us
Alien,"Makes me smell beautiful all day long.
I love it!!!!!!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I'm a BIG Angel fan... and now Alien.. bought the refill and poured it into clean, empty perfume bottle.. great savings $$$",5,Sephora,us
Alien,My mom has been using this perfume for about 3 years now and wears it every single day. She always gets compliments from men and women! I love the way it smells on her and I will be buying something from the line for Mother's Day.,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"Pine trees, fresh raspberries, leather, carrot, plain yogurt, and watercress. I love it. It lasts a very long time and it gets drier and cottony after a day.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"the very first time i smelled this perfume i totally hated it and quickly put it back on the counter,,,but recently i was given a sample and i tried it at home and i am COMPLETELY in love with alien.....i wear it to work and my co-worker tiff absolutely loves it...THE FUNNY PART IS...IS THAT ONE OF MY MARRIED CLIENTS COMES IN TO THE OFFICE AND HE JUST CANT STOP SNIFFING THE AIR AROUND ME!!! HAHAH after a few minutes he compliments me on how great i smell and asks me what i am wearing! i have never experienced this with any perfume...so ladies if a total stranger finds this scent irresistible and sexy imagine what your man is gonna do when he smells this on you!!

P.S. IF YOU TRY THIS PERFUME THE FIRST TIME AND HATE IT,,,ASK FOR A SAMPLE AND TRY IT FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS, YOU MIGHT END UP LOVING IT LIKE I DO.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,I have made this fragrance my signature scent! It is very unique and the bottle if refiliable!,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I absolutely LOVE this scent! Nearly every time I wear it, someone comments on how good I smell - and it's mostly men! I buy it in the large refillable size and refill my spray bottle to save a little on the cost. Wish I could afford to bathe in it!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,Alien is an absolutely feminine fragrance that has a beautiful floral aroma and makes me feel sexy when wearing it. One application lasts for hours and I have received so many compliments while wearing this. This is one of my favorite perfumes--it's great!,4,Sephora,us
Alien,I wasn't a big fan of Angel but Alien blew me away. Love the smell. This would be the perfume to where on that 1st date lol,5,Sephora,us
Alien,Love it!! i get so many complements from it. Just a small spray goes a long way.,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"This reminds me of Van Clef &Arpel's ""Feerie"". It has the same type of strong (long lasting) scent and is warm. I normally do not like these categories but these 2 scents are wonderful. Would recommend for evening wear.",4,Sephora,us
Alien,"i came across this unusual bottle while at sephora and not knowing it was a ""splash"" i whipped the cap off and spilled the perfume all over my hand which immediately burned and caused my knuckles to blister and & bleed..... however the smell of the perfume is just amazing! It is very unique. I can smell hints of Vanilla & amber. I am definitely going to pick this up as a winter perfume!",4,Sephora,us
Alien,This scent will make you feel so sexy it is unlike anything I have ever smelled and I adore it! If you want something that is unique that no on will be able to place but will just know you smell incredible try it,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"It's the best I've ever tryed! Stays long, great smel, I really love it, all my gf like it too after they saw it!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"Loved the fragarance in the store after spraying the mist. However, in the oil it is very strong, pretty, but use very little.",2,Sephora,us
Alien,"you come across a man that you just KNOW is THE ONE...well, this fragrance is like that man, ONE IN A MILLION. I have been through many a scent, but since I met Alien, I never looked back ;)",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I have worn Angel exclusively for the better part of 8 years and after a recent visit to Sephora, I discovered Alien which I was immediately intrigued by. It was like Angel taken to the next level. I absolutely love this fragrance.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,This is such a grown up perfume. The scent is so unique and sexy. I receive compliments every time I wear it. My son even tells me I smell pretty :),5,Sephora,us
Alien,I have been a fan of Thierry Mugler fragrances for a long time. I was in Europe when Angel was first launched and was one of the first to have it before it arrived to the US. I love Alien. I like to think of myself as feminine and sensual I fell in love with this new scent when I smelled it and I love it now that I have it.,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I think this product is fantastic. The scent stays fresh and sweet all day, but it's not sweet like candy. It's very original and I've never smelled anything similar to it. Perfect for out and about or at night. I won't be switching scents for a while!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I have worn this scent for several years. I wear it in the winter because it is a more powerful fragrance. I love the warm delicious lingering power of this scent. I don't care for Angel at all, but this is beautiful, unusual and not everyone in the world wears it.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"this is so sweet strong and sexy. every where i go, people always ask what i'm wearing!! alien makes a woman feel lucious and desireable. it's a perfect evening wear; great when you want some attention and want to make a lasting impression. my all-time fav!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,I receive so many compliments when I wear Allien - it is my favorite winter scent.,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I ordered this perfume a couple of weeks ago based on reviews and what I remembered of smelling it previously-at first it goes on really strong and I dont particularly care for the scent the first 30 minutes or so- it's not offensive but it is definitely not my favorite. However, after a bit it dries down to a nice soft, warm scent- that honestly i could take or leave- it just doesn't excite me in the way a really good knew scent has in the past. The bottle is pretty though. I gave it 4 stars because it does have a unique smell that with the right body chemistry would be wonderful- just not me I guess :)",4,Sephora,us
Alien,I love my new winter fragrance. The initial spray is very strong but it dies down shortly there after. Not very long lasting,4,Sephora,us
Alien,Love it! Thierry Mugler's fragrance are GREAT! Everybody should try it!,5,Sephora,us
Alien,Love Love Love it!!!!,5,Sephora,us
Alien,This is the best scent that I have ever worn. People complement me every time I wear this.,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"At first I thought that this perfume would be too strong based on other reviews and I also thought that it was too different. I got it 4 months ago and every day people compliment me on it. Guys have bought it for their girlfriends because they like it so much. It is so sexy, but not offensive. It lasts all day and into the night without being obnoxious. It's perfect.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"personally, I find this a little strong and much prefer Daisy or Le Eau de Issey. EVERY GUY who has ever smelled alien on me, however, has commented and said something about how sexy I smelled or how much it turned them on. So...daytime scent? not so much. date scent? only if you are ready for a man who won't leave you alone!",4,Sephora,us
Alien,"It was just over 2 years ago that I first smelled Thierry Mugler Alien on a colleague at work. Every time I walked past her, I immediately noticed her fabulous fragrance. It was one I had never experienced before and had to find out more. She told me about Alien and even gave me a sample. Once I tried it, I was hooked! I have never worn a fragrance that people consistently compliment, but with Alien, I am frequently asked what I am wearing and told what a great scent it is.

The fragrance is a little heavy, so it's perfect for fall and winter. Now is a perfect time to try Alien by Thierry Mugler. Enjoy!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"Every time I go in the Store the sales personal are always there to see if I need help. I love that they know who you are and the things you are looking for, They take the time to know you.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,i got this as a present and i'm not sure if i like it as much. The smell is a bit too strong. Maybe it's just not my type,2,Sephora,us
Alien,"Great scent...many compliments. Soft, sensuous. Feminine. Seductive. Lasts all day.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,Angel by Thierry Mugler was my scent last year but it has been pushed back by Alien!...so light...yet long lasting and oh so seductive!,5,Sephora,us
Alien,the check out experience was fast and efficient and courteous.,5,Sephora,us
Alien,I Love this fragrance!! It is strong so I spray it on a cotton ball and apply it to my pulse points. It lasts forever. I also use the Alien Prodigy Body Cream . I use it after showering. It is so rich a little goes a long way. My skin is so soft and smooth. It's worth the cost.,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"Thierry Mugler was on a transatlantic flight with the head of Clarins and they were seated in First Class as the rest of the passengers boarded the plane. An elegant woman walked past them and as she did, a waft of her fragrance immediately intrigued them. When the plane leveled off in the air, they both took turns trying to locate her to find her and ask what fragrance she was wearing. They searched throughout the plane, but could neither locate her or the fragrance.

Thierry Mugler was obsessed and created Alien from the memory of this mysterious scent he experienced. He drew on the theme of solar energy (what's more beautiful than gazing out a window of a plane and seeing the impossibly blue sky and sun's energy lighting our world? It's such a soothing, energizing vision.)

I fell in love with Alien before a friend of mine (who works for Angel) told me the story, but it makes sense. This is a mysterious, elegant fragrance that perfectly captures that allure and magnetism of light and sun.

Now for the tip:

Others have mentioned this... buy the refill! You will save $$ and cut back on packaging. And if you're really nice, they'll give you a sample too.

Enjoy!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,Best fragrance ever! There is nothing like it and stays on for soooo long,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"i adore this perfume but beware - buy the refillable bottle instead. so much better value.

this perfume is best for fall and winter, probably too heavy for spring and summer.",4,Sephora,us
Alien,"I have never had so many people ask me what fragrance I'm wearing. Men seem to really to notice it and like it(go figure!) I have to say it captivates me-I've tried to wear other fragrances for something different, but I don't feel like 'me' when I wear them!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,This is my all time fave fragrance! Rich and Unique!,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I got this for my 15 year old daughter who is not a ""girly"" girl. She absolutely loves this perfume. Its the first she has ever liked so I got it for her. She wears it every opportunity. Its a great scent and a great name!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"This perfume really is alien. It's different, beautiful and complex. The perfume lasts all day and I love the way the bottle looks.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"Fantastic scent and long lasting! I women followed me to ask what perfume I was wearing, she said I was leaving a trail of this ""wonderful"" scent throughout the store. I love it!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I got a sample because the name interested me. It was a bit strong and because I live in Arizona, I try to look for lighter scents. My mother thought it was way too strong (only ONE spritz) but after a night of sleep and a shower, I still could smell it the next day! It was a lot lighter and smelled great! But since it is pretty strong I avoided it. However, after my boyfriend raided my bathroom he said it smelled wonderful and would like me to try it. I did and he ADORED it (as did my younger brother...weird). It is strong so please, if you want to wear this, maximum of 2 spritzes. But I do recommend it :)

P.S. Guys seem to really enjoy this scent. Single ladies out there, here is something that could attract a few numbers!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"This is my signature scent among all my friends. I get random people asking me what it is whenever I wear it. There's something about it that makes it stand out.... It doesn't smell like any one thing (like a rose, gardenia, etc.) just like sun-warmed skin. I'll forever have a bottle of this around.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I love Thierry Mugler's scents, but this is my favorite one so far! I get so many compliments because it is so different.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I was traveling out of the US and tried this fragance while shopping. I decided I would shop a little more and see if in an hour or so if I still liked the smell. Oh my gosh! I was hooked, I could not hurry back quick enough to buy a bottle. I love the smell and consistently receive comments inquiring what I am wearing, everyone love it!!!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,This is the most amazing perfume i've ever smelled! I love amber so this perfume was a must! What's great about it is that the scent stays on you for a long time.,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"...""Alien"" is pure, modern emotion, presenting ordinary notes like they've never been smelled before. It opens on a brisk, mentholated sweetness, reminiscent of pistachios soaked in herbal liquor; it then develops into a deeper warmth, with creamy, jasmine florals that seem chilled from a florist's freezer, dancing around hay-like grasses and cherry-almond woods. ""Alien"" further develops into a drier, grainer blend that evokes cool sand dunes and skin musk from a day in the sun, all purified and lent moisture by cool evening air. Subtle greens touched by a plummy grape follows, truly conjuring up a summer garden at midnight--radiant plants cooling under the stars; grasses dried during day, only to slowly be rehydrated before dawn, the smell of wet earth swirling up to the sky. It all feels so immediate--so modern and present--and as such, reincarnates the hopeful vitality of youth, that feeling of the universe holding a magnitude of possibilities and some of those belonging to you. Be forewarned; ""Alien"" is synthetic smelling, but beautifully so; floral, but not remotely musty. It's a scent to ""move forward"" with--whatever that means to you--and feel confident in. A must try for avant-garde personalities.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"If you like Thierry Mugler, this is another great fragrance. I like the smoky scent.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,I have gotten so many compliments on this fragrance. I absolutely love it!,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"My ex worn this and it was super awesome and very appropriate for an grrl who looked like an alien anyway. I love this scent. It's a little too fabulously over the top for myself, and I'm already a devoted J'adore grrl, but this scent is definitely sexy.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"the men love this smell at work and my boyfriend, whom i work with gets all the credit",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"My mom always told me that each woman has to find her own scent, her signature scent....I just found mine. I love this! It's sooooo mysterious. I think it decribes me to a T! I love it!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I had to return and exchange for a different fragrance. Too strong. Very different from Angel and Angel Innocence, which I do where and love.",2,Sephora,us
Alien,"you either love it or hate it. I use to hate it and then, 4 months later, I was drawn to it. Bold, edgy, sexy, and mysteriously confident, this perfume keeps you on your toes because it changes throughout the day. Love it.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,Sensual fragrance that lasts throughout the day. Not overpowering. Constantly receive compliments when I wear this. Everyone is surprised to hear the name!,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I love love love this parfum. It is amazing, very feminine, not too flowery and not too sweet--very sensual. it lasts all day long. You only need to spray a little bit of it. I am enjoying my purchase very much!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I have been wanting to get this certain scent for a while now. It is one of the best investments I have made. The smell is extremely captivating but I would suggest to use it night. It has such a mysterious and alluring scent. Be sure to spray lightly, two sprays or less will definitely go along way. What I love most about the perfume is how long lasting it is. Splurge a little, in the long run it will definitely pay off.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"This perfume reeks of jasmine, and not in a good way. It is headache inducing and people will smell you before you enter the room, and when you leave the room the smell will linger after your presence for a long time. This is not a good thing. Perhaps if this scent wasn't so powerful or if the jasmine note wasn't so strong it would be nicer.",2,Sephora,us
Alien,"i first smelled this on a friend while staying at a lake house this fall. all week long i was trying to figure out what the incredible, intoxicating scent was. finally, while borrowing her lip gloss, i found alien in her makeup bag. i knew the small the minute i held it up to my nose. as soon as i got back, the first thing i did was buy 2oz of the stuff...my boyfriend loves it, and i've even been stopped in a few stores and had people ask me what i'm wearing!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I had to try this because I love the name. Alien! To my pleasant surprise, I love the fragrance just as much. It's soft; a good scent for a night out.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"All too often you find fragrances that have a great scent, and that smell ""good"" on you too. Ten minutes after applying, it's gone!
This one here is a winner. Truly long lasting, constant fragrance, simply captivating.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"This is a very dark and seductive floral scent that is quite pretty. It has some very intriguing and mysterious notes that you can't exactly pick out, which make it almost sensual. It's initially very strong, and then dries down a little softer. This is a heavy scent that I would reserve for winter or a night out......because it can be a little much, especially if to much is sprayed ...while I think it's nice it's a bit heavy for me, and gives me a headache!!!",4,Sephora,us
Alien,"Past favorites have been Gucci by Gucci, Euphoria by Calvin Klein and now this yummy concoction by Thierry Mugler!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I only wear two other types of perfume, Beautiful and Hypnose. I am very choosey when it comes to perfume because of allergies. I do not particularly like the smell of this perfume when I first put it on. The closest thing that I can think of that it smells like to me is a room insect fogger. I think this is why if I put to much on, I would get a headache. After that initial smell wears off, it does have a nice smell to it. Will I wear it? Probably spearingly every once in awhile.",4,Sephora,us
Alien,"This is one of my absolute favorite fragrances! I wasn't sure how I would feel about the gel but it's easy to apply and lasts for hours. As always, tons of compliments!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I just absolutely love the way this smells! It's not as harsh as Angel seems to some (though I personally love that one too). It smells nothing at all like Angel, not even slightly similar. This one is a little sweet and very soft. Just a verrrry pretty scent. The scent just keeps on smelling good long after you put it on too. Love this one!!!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I still don't understand why Thierry would call this fragrance ""Alien"" but having read he has strong ""futuristic"" influences, I will let it go right there. If it was up to me, I would call this fragrance ""Who's That Girl"" because that is the kind of reaction you get when people get a whiff of your fragrance.

I am a ""fragrance snob"" and have only ever used 2 perfumes in my entire lifetime: Tommy Girl by Tommy Hilfiger and Euphoria by Calvin Klein. I stopped using Tommy when I turned 25 because it is a ""girly"" fragrance and immediately went on to Euphoria, which I love with a passion. However, Euphoria can be quiet ""dictative"" in terms of the types of clothes you wear because it is a very classy fragrance and can be extremely heady in hot weather, so I went searching for a ""cooler"" fragrance. However, I hate floral scents due to my sinusitis so most summer scents are just not for me.

Enter Thierry. I HATE Angel - it BLOWS you away with it's top notes. I immediately had a headache upon sniffing it but out of curiousity of the strange, purple bottle, I gave Alien a sniff and I was once again BLOWN away - but pleasantly so this time. It works very, very well with my near-death devotion to Euphoria. I bought it not only because it smells SO divine but also because I can wear it without feeling like I am cheating on my Euphoria. It is indeed a welcome addition to my (limited) fragrance wardrobe.

It is very heady at first - tends to give me a slight headache but true to all Thierry's fragrances, it is VERY potent so less is more - go easy on it. Not only that but, just like my Euphoria, it lasts for a VERY long time so very, very, very easy does. Otherwise you risk getting a headache and giving everyone else one, too.

I was quiet surprised that it is a ""soft floral"". I could have sworn that this is a woody oriental. It is exotic and alluring - factors that you don't find in floral scents.

I actually give it a 4 and a half out of 5 due to the slight headache it gives. Overall, a very good fragrance!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I am not even sure how to describe this scent other than I have never smelled anything like it. After applying this perume the initial note is very pleasant. The second note I am not too fond of but it quickly changes. The third note smells so exotic and foreign that I can't stop niffing the pulse point on my wrists! I have received a tremendous amount of compliments on this, the most surprising one from by best friend who HATES perfume. This scent is so alluring and my new favorite!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,What a surprise. This fragrance is wonderful. I receive so many compliments. My husband brought it for me last Christmas and I never heard of it so I didn't wear it until recently. What a surprise. Alien makes me feel sexy.,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"WOW, I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT TO SAY....THIS FRAGRANCE IS THE BEST THAT I HAVE EVER SMELLED....I HAVE GOTTEN SO MANY COMPLIMENTS....IT WAS SO WORTH THE MONEY.....VERY SEXY, AND SEDUCTIVE.....LOVE IT!!!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"if you love Angel, you will love Alien. lasts forever and everyone will remember your scent. spicey and sexy.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,I LOOOVE the smell of Alien! I've never owned any perfume like it. I also love that they sell a refill bottle! Which makes buying this unique yummy smelling perfume less expensive. The refill bottle even came with a cute little funnel for making transfering the perfume easier without wasting a single drop;o),5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I really like this fragrance. It is one that I have had a few people who are close to me feel it was too strong, but I think the scent is heady, warm, dark and sexy.",4,Sephora,us
Alien,"I Fall in love with it the first time I smell it, it's convenient for winter. Strong and heavy but luxurous, sexy seductive, sensual fragrance. I've been stopped everywhere (work, street, mall) asking what I am wearing! a must have!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"the product design of the bottle is very alluring, but the scent is out of this of world. I first was introduced to the scent by a sample found in the Sephora catalog. I wore the sample and the reactions of those around was unanimous. Everyone loved it, especially me. Perfect for going out, or staying in with the man. Excellent scent. I would recommend to anyone, but I'd rather covet it for myself. Hehe.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"This scent is perfect for the Fall and Winter season. It's a heavier scent. I also don't do florals, but there is something so different and sensual about this scent. It makes me heady in a good way. I have received compliments also and they love the different scen too.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"seriously, this is my signature fragrance.
i smelled it on this girl i met at camp and i just had to have it.
its hard to describe it, but it always makes me feel sexy.
kinda glad im the only person posting for my age group cuz i dont want everyone smelling like it.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"So worth my $200 haha. I randomly bought it when it first came out. I was looking for a brand I haven't heard of before and for a weird name and it paid off haha. It smells wonderful, I don't even know how to describe it. People always ask what I'm wearing and my coworkers follow me around just because it smells nice haha. Silly but cool. They even gave me a candle when I bought it too, it's the same smell ^^",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"This is an every occasion perfume BUT BEWARE! It has awesome side effects that you'll absolutely love! LIke many compliments, sniffing and hearing ppl ask what's that smell, and feeling sexy and demure when you wear it. This is my standard night on the town perfume! Guys love it and it smells like nothing else on this earth! NO JOKE!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"i normally don't do floral scents, but i love this perfume. it's surpisingly dark.. it reminds me of a moonlit garden. ... and i love deco bottle",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"This is my mothership. This is the perfume I lean on. This is my signature scent. This is moi bebe! You know, I don't want everyone one to wear this, but I can't help but give it a good evaluation, because Thierry Mugler deserves it!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"I absolutley love this scent, it's sexy and sweet at the same time..I love all Thierry's scents, because they smell fresh, but this one has an extra kick!",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"This perfume has a enticing fragrance, that seems to captivate me. It is mysterious and sensual. I am not one to love floral perfumes, but Alien has such a combination of notes that don't bother me, on the contrary, I can't help but to be drawn to this perfume. It is like a surreal work of art, there is so much there, but you can't quite figure it all out. Things you thought could not be combined, are combined and distorted creating a mysterious world.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,I am have been stopped on the street by strangers asking what I am wearing.,5,Sephora,us
Alien,I have been stopped many times since I started wearing Alien and received MANY compliments. I don't like the name. The scent is amazing though!!!,5,Sephora,us
Alien,this perfume is like nothing i've used my boyfriend really loves it. and i get alot of compliments when i use it.,5,Sephora,us
Alien,I think that Angel Alien is amazing. People stop me all of the time and ask me the incrediblly wonderful perfume I am wearing. I wear both Angel and Angel Alien. They are both fabulous.,5,Sephora,us
Alien,"My boyfriend bought this perfume for me for Christmas, as we are both fans of Thierry Mugler's Angel (both the mens' and womens' scents). I was a bit surprised by the bottle and the name of the perfume. I tried it and was amazed. I've tried many classic and modern scents and tend to fall in love with orientals and spicy, vanilla-based fragrances and while this one isn't either of those things, I can't really fit it into one single fragrance category. It is so unique and I receive more compliments when wearing it than I have have with any other scent. It smells PURPLE. It reminds me of grapes and flowers and there are notes which I can't really describe but which are seductive and pleasing. I will continue to keep this scent in my collection as I've yet to encounter another woman wearing it (a plus for an aries girl like myself) and because it is just beautiful.",5,Sephora,us
Alien,"When I first saw the name of this fragrance I thought, ""Are you serious?"" Then I tried it. Mmmmmmmm. It really does seduce my senses. The bottle is really unique, and I love that the parfum is a beautiful purple. This made my Saturday morning.",4,Sephora,us
Angel Muse,"received sample in one of my purchases, went and bought the bottle the next day. at first it reminds me of the old perfume red door, that fades aways into heaven.",5,Sephora,us
Angel Muse,Smells delicious and addictive. Perfect fragrance for night time or cold weather. It’s smells like chocolate and creamy hazelnut but not overly sweet. Im obsessed!,5,Sephora,us
Angel Muse,"I know it's not the perfume's fault but on me it smells very powdery instead of the sweet candy I keep reading about ahah! I got it as a sample so yeah as for any perfume, try it on before you purchase!!!",3,Sephora,us
Angel Muse,"Definitely makes me feel like a Rolls-Royce! I absolutely recommend this over even Diesel Loverdose! I can’t wait to try the other fragrances! Very sweet and has a good vanilla tone to it, and a little bit really lasts2+ days when sprayed on your jacket collar.",5,Sephora,us
Angel Muse,I did not like this the first couple times I sprayed it on myself. But today I decided to give it another try and omg am I happy I did. It’s beautiful and delicious smelling. Definitely going to put a full bottle,5,Sephora,us
Angel Muse,Smells like insect/bug killer spray.  This was way too strong for me that it gave me a headache every time I sprayed it. The intensity of the scent was way too overwhelming and bitter that it made me nauseous.,1,Sephora,us
Angel Muse,I was surprised by how much I ended up loving this fragrance. It smells wonderfully sweet and walks a perfect balance between professional and sexy. It also lasts all day and is a lovely strength where it’s noticeable but not in the least overpowering. I don’t know why Sephora classifies it as spicy when really it’s heavy on the whipped cream scent (and artificial cherry but in a good way) and feels very velvety and gourmand. It is unconventional but familiar and so subtle and nuanced. I’m a huge fan!,5,Sephora,us
Angel Muse,Love Love this perfume,4,Sephora,us
Angel Muse,"I usually go for sweet scents when buying perfume. This one is definitely different from any of my other perfumes! It’s creative in its own way, and nobody else will smell
like you trust me!! The smell is really, really sweet..but in a more refined, classy way. It doesn’t smell like a perfume for a teenybopper though. I’ll be wearing this perfume in the winter because it’s a very warm, strong, sweet fragrance. Perfect for the cold weather!!",4,Sephora,us
Angel Muse,"Man, this is a gorgeous scent. I was just revisiting some of my fall perfumes for some reason and came across this one. I actually emptied my bottle last fall but kept it in case I needed to smell it again, apparently in situations like this. LOL! I am terrible at describing perfumes, especially gourmands, but it is a magnificent, warm, sweet yet spiced, delicious frag that lasts forever, but is not too young or immature, and not at all too elderly. Will have to purchase again...I definitely miss this one!!",5,Sephora,us
Angel Muse,Best fragrance everrrrrrrrr!,5,Sephora,us
Angel Muse,Wore this at work yesterday and got lots of compliments on it.,5,Sephora,us
Angel Muse,I wore the original angel from 2005-2019 and the formula seemed to change. After a month of trying multiple perfumes I discovered this one and it smells so much like the original Angel from the 90’s. I am in love!!,5,Sephora,us
Angel Muse,"Amazing scent, doesn't fade immediately like some perfumes, one spray goes a long way. Also probably my favourite perfume line bottle designs.",5,Sephora,us
Angel Muse,"This scent is odd, the first time I tried it I didn't like it. It smelled medicinal if that makes sense. My husband loved it as did my daughter. So I gave it another go, after some dry down I have grown to love it. It has a nice chocolaty with something I can't identify scent on me. It lasts all day and night. I bought the 1oz bottle and it has lasted quite a long time. I will by the bigger bottle next time. I would recommend that you try this a few times to see if you like it. It's not a scent for everyone. I think that is with any Mugler scent.",5,Sephora,us
Angel Muse,Gorgeous winter scent. Though is quite strong I would recommend not instantly sniffing the perfume after spraying it or it will smell to strong instead let the scent come to you.,5,Sephora,us
Angel Muse,Muse is amazing it smells so delicious!!! I highly recommend it especially for fall and winter,5,Sephora,us
Angel Muse,"I bought this blind after watching Charles Gross' review of holiday perfumes. I am in love! It smells so lovely... It smells like candied nuts and hazelnut chocolate with delicious spices. If someone described a perfume like that to me, I'd probably not want to try it but it just works. And it lasts FOREVER! One spray on my neck 12 hours ago and I still smell it. I never thought I could have a signature scent, but this is it.",5,Sephora,us
Angel Muse,"This reminds me of the kids perfumes that we could get in the 80’s! It’s very sweet, and if you want to smell like candy or doll hair this is the perfume for you. It’s definitely not a mature scent.",2,Sephora,us
Angel Muse,"Can I/we get some Angel Muse accessories for the holidays? A gel, a creme, a lotion? This scent either is too good for those things, or too good not to have them.",5,Sephora,us
Angel Muse,"I fell in love with this scent immediately. The first day I wore it, a handsome stranger told me I smelled amazing and said it was perfect - “elegant and soft”. Umm...lifetime supply please! ;)",5,Sephora,us
Angel Muse,"Smells too sharp and chemically to detect any chocolate or hazelnut on me, my friend said I smelled like cleaning products. Dissappointed",1,Sephora,us
Angel Muse,"I love the original Angel perfume, but this is a nice lighter/sweeter option. I feel like this works better for daytime and work, where original Angel is great for evenings or a date. Although they are similar, I do enjoy having both.",5,Sephora,us
Angel Muse,"The more I wear Angel Muse, it is becoming one of my most reached for scents (I have probably close to 50 fragrances). I have worn Original Angel edp since 1994. In fact it is the ONLY fragrance that I never run out, and never cycle out of my rotation. As discussed on this Forum, IFRA reformulations have really hurt original Angel edp. I used to use 1-2 sprays and I would literally get compliments daily and it would last 8-12 hours on my skin. Now, I can use 10 sprays and it is gone, totally, within hours. I also do not remember the last time someone told me how good I smell whilst wearing Angel. This used to happen daily, sometimes multiple times!
Angel Muse seems to last much longer on me than Angel edp, and it is such a warm, rich, decadent scent. Patchouli, hazelnut, vanilla, soft spices and the longevity and sillage are excellent, but never (to me at least) offensive! I LOVE Angel Muse eau de Parfum (the Toilette version is not a fav or mine).",5,Sephora,us
Angel Muse,"I have loved Thierry Mugler's perfumes as it adheres well to my skin and transforms beautifully! Living in hot climates, I need a scent that lingers but is not overpowering or weak. I love how Angel Muse has an oriental, floral, woody vanilla smell to it. I smell like toasted vanilla at the end of the day, yum!",5,Sephora,us
Angel Muse,"I will say when I smelled the original Angel I hated it, it wasn't very good and smelled like licorice to me. I wear Alien which is very floral and jasminey. I just received the Angel Muse today and omg not to be dramatic but I'm never buying any other perfumes again. It's SO good I can't stop sniffing the bottle. It's very sweet and has a brightness to it, and a little mystery, like you smell it and want to keep smelling it and it smells edible but unlike anything I've smelled before. You can smell the individual notes, I really smell the nuts lightly and the whipped cream. I know some sweeter perfumes smell like something a 13 year old would wear, this isn't like that, it's wonderful and more mature than your usual sweet foody perfume. Ugh. My new holy grail. Coming from a girl with like probably over 30 perfumes I keep buying cause I cant find one I truly love, and this is it omg I'm shocked 10/10 recommend.",5,Sephora,us
Angel Muse,"such an elegant and tasteful smell, youthful yet sophisticated, and lasts all day!!! 100% recommend! however, don’t over spritz or else it’s far too overpowering",5,Sephora,us
Angel Muse,"Love it! I have used Angel for several years but needed a change. This is perfect! Warm, slightly spicy and never overpowering!",5,Sephora,us
Angel Muse,This is the kind of perfume that would suffocate you if someone had this on in an elevator.  Even after washing where I sprayed it I could still smell it.,1,Sephora,us
Angel Muse,I haven't felt this way about a perfume in a long time.  I love everything about it.  The scent is intoxicating and it lasts.  I have never gotten so many compliments from strangers telling me how good I smell and asking me what am I wearing.  I think we will be in a committed relationship for a very long time.  <3,5,Sephora,us
Angel Muse,This perfume is absolutely beautiful i am obssesed over it smells so good,5,Sephora,us
Angel Muse,It reminds me a lot of the original Angel but it is spicier and it lasts a really long time. After sleeping and going into the next day the scent is still on my skin so make sure you spritz lightly.,4,Sephora,us
Angel Muse,My first Mugler scent and I fell in love. The scent is great and not to overwhelming.,5,Sephora,us
Angel Muse,"This smells like Angel mixed with Nutella! I love it! Mugler perfumes are high quality. I'm allergic to whatever they put in cheap perfumes, but Mugler uses high quality oils only. I've never had a problem.",5,Sephora,us
Angel Muse,"Smells so beautiful and youthful without that childish ""candy"" smell. My mother in law smelled it on me and went and got it the next day",5,Sephora,us
Angel Muse,I received a sample of this and found it stronger than I expected which is such a shame. I was looking forward to trying it.,1,Sephora,us
Angel Muse,This smells horrible..,1,Sephora,us
Angel Muse,"It smells exactly the same as the original, especially in the dry down . Times ten. I don't understand those who are saying otherwise. It's too much of everything. You know how there are"" garbage salads"" ? This is a ""garbage scent"". Super thick fudge and  incompatible earthiness. Add me to the list of people who don't get the raves it's getting.",1,Sephora,us
Angel Muse,"This does not last on me. The only time I smell the fragrance is when I spray it. I can spray it 10 times and 10 min later I don't smell anything. Thinking it would be like Angel where 1 spray lasts a day, this is a super let down. No compliments either after a week of using it heavily hoping the scent would stick. So it's not just me. Pass.",1,Sephora,us
Angel Muse,Delicious! Absolutely yummy!,5,Sephora,us
Angel Muse,"It's my new favorite. Sweet, creamy, and rich without being overwhelming. I don't particularly like it when I first apply it but once it's settled it's lovely.",5,Sephora,us
Angel Muse,"This perfume is highly unique to each individual. So much so that it smells COMPLETELY different on me depending on what time of the month it is. When my hormones shift its beautiful, delicate and full of chocolate notes. The other half of the month it's masculine and full of patchouli. If you're on the fence with this one, try it out when your hormones are elevated and when they aren't.",5,Sephora,us
Angel Muse,"I received Angel Muse as a roller-ball sample and immediately fell in love. There are other scents I like slightly more - but I've never had a perfume that lasted as long as this one. When I first tried it (before my nose started tuning it out), I applied it in the morning before work, and could still smell it the next morning before I jumped in the shower. On me, it's very sweet smelling with spicy overtones.",5,Sephora,us
Angel Muse,I bought a sample of this and immediately rushed on sephora to purchase the full bottle. Thierry muglar never disappoints,5,Sephora,us
Angel Muse,"I am very very picky when it comes to scents,  Angel Muse I tested over a few months before committing and I don't regret it. It doesn't change into some annoying scent after time, like most of perfumes and always gives this very fine delicate vanilla fragrance. I use it very single day and can't get enough.",5,Sephora,us
Angel Muse,"If you are scrolling through the reviews, you can probably see that this fragrance is polarizing, which I can confirm is true. I have never thought much of the Angel line or really any Mugler, but Angel Muse is truly one-of-a-kind. It is sultry, warm, and chocolaty, which is a winning winter combination. 

I am in my early 20s, and have been filtering out youthful sicky-sweet scents for things that are more mature, and I love this because while it is adult, it still has an extremely unique bite. This is definitely not a gift fragrance, it must be tried out because it's like nothing you've tried before. 

(And the sleek bottle design is lovely as well!)",5,Sephora,us
Angel Muse,"I could never carry off Angel. Something about it felt like a dollar store version of Barbie. A strong plasticky note annoyed me. This version I was suprised I could wear and like. Its very close to the original without the wierd synthetic scent.....it carries a more natural hazelnut essence in its place. Much more pleasing to your senses, and others! I'd reccomend this to anyone who likes scents like La Vie Est Belle or even YSL Black Opium. Its sweet...sugary sweet but with a neo-punk edge.",3,Sephora,us
Angel Muse,"i own 2 bottles of this and its so yummy. its also a unisex scent which is nice. I LOVE IT!! sexy , lil sweet, creamy, warm, soft clean and alluring. better than original angel. totally addicted!",5,Sephora,us
Angel Muse,"I really love how unique this fragance is, I always get compliments when I wear it.",5,Sephora,us
Angel Muse,So... I've avoided Angel for so long and just realized how lovely it smells on my skin. Then I tried Angel Muse and fell in love all over again. It's softer and gourmand but has great staying power. I can apply in morning and it's dry down still lingers all day. The feel of the bottle in the hand is nice and easy too as you spray your skin lightly with its mist.,5,Sephora,us
Angel Muse,"I was totally disappointed in this new scent by Mugker. It had no staying power and did not make me happy, surprised Mugler created it.",1,Sephora,us
Angel Muse,"I'm not sure what the all the rage is about.
This smells exactly like Angel-
On me at least...
I love Angel - so it's a win-win...
But, I was actually hoping for something a little different... especially since I still have a brand new bottle of the original Angel...
Oh well...

As for lasting power - both scents have amazing staying/lasting power...

So, If you like/love Angel - you'll like/love Angel Muse & vice versa - 
'cause it pretty much smells the same...",4,Sephora,us
Angel Muse,"I'm scent-obsessed with a huge collection!  A friend gifted me her Allure Magazine... something both earthy and otherworldly wafted out of its pages when I opened it. It was love at first breath!  I knew I couldn't live without ever smelling this again! I found the Ad & the sample...rubbed it on my neck & wrists & used it until my order arrived!  My skin doesn't respond well to the light, citrusy, boring, girly fragrances that are all the rage now. Thankfully, not a whiff of hazelnut on my skin. Hazelnut makes me nauseous. Angel Muse literally smells ""bittersweet"" on me - like dark chocolate and sweet cream meringue! ! It lasts for 2 days on me! And the mix of a woody/patchouli dry down gives it that slightly smoky, bittersweet edge on my skin! ! No one every figures out what I'm wearing. My body chemistry makes all scents smell ""strange & different on me. This is the only fragrance to grab my interest in 20 years! I love the classic, bold scents of yore! Those which are called ""old lady smells""! I grew up in NYC where there are no rules! I also mix (original) Angel with A*Men & Angel Muse! I consider this fragrance Unisex.  It is my new Classic! I've got 3 bottles & am ordering my fourth. I take one wherever I go!  Mugler's Angel Muse will stand side by side with my delightful ""old lady smell"" classics that get so many compliments from both men and  women!  I'm bold, I'm eccentric and I'm ecstatic that I appreciate the Classic fragrances. Angel Muse is most definitely my new classic that I wear for any occasion - just like my older classics, especially after a bath in the evening! The only thing I've been wearing to bed lately is Angel Muse!  A must try for any man or woman!",5,Sephora,us
Angel Muse,"Upon reading the notes of the original Angel, I thought I would love it! Alas, the notes did not translate at all. This reincarnation is exactly what I imagined for Angel. It has the warmth, but a uniqueness to it. Truly needs to be smelled in person. It is not your typical  Gourmand that you will find everywhere else, and it has me sniffing my wrist over and over.",4,Sephora,us
Angel Muse,"What a deliciously weird fragrance! I think Thierry Mugler was successful in his mission to recreate Angel into a newer version for today's young women.  I absolutely HATED the original Angel because of the way it smelled like sweat. Though Angel Muse has similarities with the original (e.g., the patchouli and the gourmand notes), it smells a lot cleaner. 

The best way I can describe Angel Muse is that it smells like marshmallows and hazelnut chocolate truffles melting on a campfire in a forest. It's sweet, nutty, and slightly woody. It's extremely addicting and I literally couldn't stop sniffing my arm. It's not the most office appropriate fragrance, nor is it one that I would recommend for formal settings. But it's a great fragrance to wear for yourself and for fun, especially if you like sweet gourmands.",5,Sephora,us
Angel Muse,"Typically I really am not a fan of powdery perfumes but this is my favorite perfume I've ever smelled.  It's very clean and flirty.  I've gotten a lot of compliments on it, and even my husband loves it and he hates all my perfumes I wear lol.",5,Sephora,us
Angel Muse,I love this scent! I think its very unique.,5,Sephora,us
Angel Muse,In love with the Hazelnut smell. Got it as a sample with my points. Wish a normal sized bottle didn't cost so much. $20-$30 maybe. but not $95. like OMG!,5,Sephora,us
Angel Muse,"I got a sample of the original Angel perfume thats blue a few months ago and the smell was so nauseating and headache inducing that i threw it in the trash and immediately started washing my wrists to get rid of the horrible smell. Forward to now, I took a chance and used my beauty points to get a deluxe sample of angel muse because some reviewers said they hated the original one but loved this one. Ive had it one my wrist for a few hours and it smells HEAVENLY! definitely nothing like the original and if it is, i dont smell it! It smells kind of like a mix of bubblegum and floral to me. Now Im thinking of trying the alien one!",4,Sephora,us
Angel Muse,"Very medicinal, very sweet. Dies down to a really sweet, but earthy scent. It was way too much for me, even a little spritz and I was worried it would overwhelm anyone around me. Such a weird perfume, I just honestly can't get into it. I was surprised to see how well received it is.",2,Sephora,us
Angel Muse,"I've worn Angel Muse twice now, and I love it. It is similar to Angel, but earthier and just as beautiful to smell. So many compliments from strangers on how good I smell.",5,Sephora,us
Angel Muse,"I HATE the original Angel perfume.  It gives me a headache on me or on others.  But, I got a tiny sample of this and thought I'd try it.  Surprisingly I LOVE it.  It is reminiscent of Angel without the cloying overwhelming aspects.  On my skin it isn't that sweet and the woody scent isn't too green, it just warms it up.  My husband also really likes it.  He has not really liked any perfume on me since Chloe Narcisse which I wore when we met.  That tells you how long it's been.  For reference if you are considering this I also like perfumes like the original Burberry, Chanel Mademoiselle, a LIGHT spritz of Divine Decadence after it dried down for about 20 minutes.  Even if you really dislike all other Mugler scents you might want to try this.  It is really fab and not over powering like his other perfumes.  But it does last on the skin.  My new signature scent.  Finally!",5,Sephora,us
Angel Muse,"I am not a fan of the original ""cult favorite"" Angel AT ALL. Its headache inducing and just does not go well with my chemistry. This fragrance was on my must try list after reading the notes and the reviews. In one whiff I knew it was a match. This smells absolutely divine...its sexy, gourmand, mature without being old lady like, just amazing. It smells like a well dressed woman eating a decadent chocolate ganache dessert alone in a ritzy boutique hotel. I love the packaging also, but the only compliant I have is that the bottle does not stand up. Other than that, please go out and buy the biggest bottle you can find of this!",5,Sephora,us
Angel Muse,"I'm a long time fan of Angel. I wanted to try something else in Thierry Mugler's line but didn't like Alien. After I got a whiff of the new Angel Muse I couldn't stop smelling my wrist. Just a couple of sprays lasts all day without overpowering the nose. Some sprays last 2-4 hours, this one lasts 8-10 hrs or longer. The smaller container is great for travel.",5,Sephora,us
Angel Muse,"I have always admired angel, but have never been able to wear it for more than just a day (using a sample), as it's very potent in the patchouli note.  It was so strong that it smelled medicinal.  I love straight patchouli essential oil, but the way it's formulated in the original Angel perfume, it dried down to something armpit like on me.  Slightly sour, sweet patchouli weirdness!   But this Angel Muse version is everything I had wished in the original.  Same sweet, mysterious patchouli/slight berry creeps in smelling just like the original, but the hazelnut creaminess takes over rounding it all out.  Dulling the patchouli just enough to make it more enjoyable, and to make the dry down less nauseating.  It's sweeter, but not immature sweet.  It also has a hint of vetiver keeping it lighter.  I think it helps keep the patchouli less heavy, giving it just a slight hint of masculinity (like a very subtle hint of Abercrombie Fierce), in a unisex way.   I dig it.  I bought it.  And I'll be wearing it all the time.   (:",5,Sephora,us
Angel Muse,"I received a sample of this and initially really liked the scent.  However, I wore it today and after awhile I began to feel very overwhelmed by the smell.  That's when I realized it smells just like the candied nuts you can buy at the mall or some events.  They smell great, but I don't want to walk around smelling like that all day.  Unfortunately for me, the staying power is very good on this perfume.  If you love very sweet scents then you may love this; it's a nice scent, just far too sweet and overwhelming for me to wear.  I would prefer the scent as a candle rather than a perfume.",3,Sephora,us
Angel Muse,"I am a fan of original Angel but find it overpowering at times.  This one is like a toned down version of it, which is also different - on me it dries down to smell like a subtler Angel mixed with vanilla a subtle peppery scent to it as well.  It's very nice and lasts all day.  I love it!",5,Sephora,us
Angel Muse,"None of the other Mugler perfumes have appealed to me, but when I got this sample from Sephora I had to have it! 

It's a sassy, yummy, and strong scent! I'm patiently waiting on my full size to come in the mail <3",5,Sephora,us
Angel Muse,"It has been a long time since I have really been drawn to a fragrance. My husband said it smelled like a ""candle""?' I say it smells like ""me"".i will probably wear this a very long time and enjoy the deep mysterious way it smells!",5,Sephora,us
Angel Muse,This scent stayed from 8 am to 11pm without missing a beat. Super sweet and warm; perfect for the winter!,5,Sephora,us
Angel Muse,"Smells like the sweet peach champagne version of angel with the same powdery undertone. Very addictive, its amazing!",5,Sephora,us
Angel Muse,"This is definitely a woody-gourmand with emphasis on gourmand. I am extremely picky about gourmand scents. Anything with too much vanilla tends to smell burnt with my skin chemistry. This did not, fortunately. Also, I have to admit that I have never worn the original Angel, so I can't make a comparison there. 

I found this scent to be comforting and cozy, like a soft sweater and a mug of chai on a chilly fall day. My husband raves about how good I smell when I wear it. It seems like it could be a sexy scent under the right circumstances. 

For comparison, it reminds me of a short-lived scent called Cashmere from TBS, a Coco Mademoiselle flanker called Cherie (I think), a Hilary Duff scent (With Love, I guess?) and a tad of Lolita Lempicka. I'm 32 and I feel like I'm just on the borderline of being too old for a sweet-gourmand scent like this, but it's fun.",5,Sephora,us
Angel Muse,"I used to wear Angel exclusively and for years it was my secret weapon. I would have people come up to me and ask what I was wearing...in the grocery store, at the bank, you name it! Then came the reformulation and it completely stopped working with my skin, I was so sad. I recently tried Angel Muse on a whim and after an hour I recognized the heavenly scent! This is the closest I've ever gotten to achieving that original heavenly Angel scent from the 90's! I've received so many compliments that I smell intoxicating. I'm in LOVE and feeling nostalgic, but it IS Thierry Mugler so try before you buy, his scents are notiorious for adapting to the wearer in a very specific way. It's love it or hate it.",5,Sephora,us
Angel Muse,"First of all, I hate the original Angel. It smells absolutely awful on me. Then came Alien and I was surprised I liked it. Today, I got a sample of Angel Muse and I am blown away. It's a completely new scent that wows me. I love perfumes and wear a different scent everyday because I have hundreds of samples, usually leaning towards florals and citrus and tuberose. Joy is my all time favorite. Even though the last thing I need is more perfumes, I could see myself purchasing this scent it is that good and unexpected.",5,Sephora,us
Angel Muse,"This is the first Mugler perfume I've been able to wear that doesn't smell like dirty arm pits on me. I love, love all his fragrances and love them on other people. On me, the patchouli turns very sour. Angel Muse does not do this. It's a lovely oriental, gourmand mix. The top notes are delicious, but fade instantly. The base is warm and sexy with that caramel base that so many of his fragrances have. But...sadly, it fades on me in about 30 minutes. Does not stay at all on my skin. So I spray it on my hair and clothes. It hangs in my hair and clothes very well. I hope he comes out with a nice body cream so I can layer it and get more oomph.",3,Sephora,us
Angel Muse,Soft sweet scent that lasts all day! Will definitely keep this around!,5,Sephora,us
Angel Muse,Can't get enough if this! I've worn Angel for years and I love how this dries down! I actually paired it up with Angel and they smell gorgeous together! Shout out to Cherry Creek Sephora! You guys are always AMAZING!,5,Sephora,us
Angel Muse,"Angel has always been my favorite, and this is no exception! Fresh take on the Angel scent!",5,Sephora,us
Angel Muse,"I've always loved Angel but it was just a little overpowering on me.  I read the description of this one and had to give it a try.  Already in my daily perfume rotation.  It lasts a long time but I love that it really mixes into the skin and truly smells different on everyone.  I was working out about 6 hours after I applied it and kept stopping to figure out who smelled so good.  Turns out it was me!!  I would definitely recommend.  I don't see the note about limited edition though.  I hope they keep this one around.  I agree it reminds me of YSL Black Opium, but not a dupe.  They are similar but different!  I love them both.",5,Sephora,us
Angel Muse,"I bought this online, without having smelled it--smell untried. I am a a fan of Angel, Angel Inncoent and Angel Eau de Toilette, so I was pretty sure I'd like this scent as well. I'd describe it as similar to Angel Innocent--not as heavy as Angel, but a little more vanilla (reminds me a little of Opium, maybe, only lighter). It's heavier than Innocent, but not heavy.

It lasts all day, and like Angel, it changes drastically from one person to another. My daughter tried it, and she loves it as well--her scent smells like vanilla, thou, but mine is a but spicier--from the same bottle.

I know it says this is a limited edition, and I wish I'd purchased the larger bottle now. I adore this fragrance! I'll definitely buy more. It reminds me a little of when Angel had the other combinations--Angek Peony, Angel Lily, etc, from a few years ago. It's simply wonderful and decadent, and not for the timid.",5,Sephora,us
Angel Muse,"Smells wonderful, not as strong as the original angel but in a good way.",5,Sephora,us
Angel Muse,I could not love this product more!! It's like a sweet vanilla powder puff but has edge from notes of Vetiver and grapefruit. I could never wear Original Angel but it smells amazing on my Mom. This Angel Muse is MY way to wear angel. It also layers nicely with Angel body oil and body cream :) LOVE that they are making refillable bottles as well.,5,Sephora,us
Angel Muse,I walked into Sephora not planning to buy a fragrance but someone showed me this and I couldn't leave without it. This is be so perfect in winter/fall!,5,Sephora,us
Angel Muse,"I usually hate department store perfume they all have the same dry down stench..

I love all aspects of this fragrance, I'll have to buy a bottle!",5,Sephora,us
Angel Muse,Makes me smell very rich,5,Sephora,us
Angel Muse,"I recently smelled this in store and it was very nice. It smelled to me like Alien meets YSL Black Opium. I own both of those fragrances and love them so this was appealing to me. I hate Angel so I was skeptical of this new Angel Muse fragrance. To me, it doesn't smell like Angel at all so that's a plus in my book!",4,Sephora,us
Angel Muse,"OMG Angel Muse ❤️is eXtraOrdinary!!! Ever since day I got whiff of this I KNEW it was for me..I've had mugler parfum in past and they sit heavanly plus long hours of wear and now latest mugler creation leaves me blown away..this is my scent ...happy I have samples of Angel Muse until it arrives.

Angel Muse,"Smells heavenly. If you're finding its too strong, don't forget the cloud gesture! Spray in front of you and walk through it, perfect scent every time",5,Sephora,us
Angel Muse,Such a beautiful summer scent. It's rich and warm without being too heavy making it appropriate for daytime wear. In love!,5,Sephora,us
Angel Muse,"I am a big fan of Angel: the original, the eau de toilette, innocent and eau Sucree. So it not a surprise I like this one too. It is a very gourmand yet sophisticate scent. The addition of Vetiver  is brilliant. I use it with my Angel shower gel( favorite product ever) and body lotion... It all blends beautifully",5,Sephora,us
Angel Muse,"Angel is my go-to perfume. I got this Muse one as a sample, and it's similar to the original but less strong....feels more like a summer scent. Just like Angel, the scent lasts a long time! Love it!",5,Sephora,us
